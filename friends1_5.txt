<p align="left"></b>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> <font color="#0000FF">All right Joey, be
nice.&nbsp; </font>So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, does he eat chalk?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(They all stare, bemused.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Sounds like a date to me.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">[Time Lapse]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>All:</strong> Oh, yeah. Had that dream.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Instead of...?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> That's right.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Never had that dream.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
<font color="#0000FF">Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. </font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Monica:</b> And they weren't looking at
you before?!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Chandler:</b> Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, </font><font color="#000000">a</font>nd it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (mortified) Hi.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Are you okay, sweetie?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Cookie?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Joey:</b> Ohh.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><b>Monica:</b></font><font
color="#0000FF"> </font>(to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Ross:</b> Thanks.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine!&nbsp; Be murky!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><b>Ross:</b> </font>I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No you don't.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> And you never knew she was a lesbian...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Ross:</b> I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Monica:</b> Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., &quot;I'll never have
grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.&quot; was what?&nbsp; A wrong number?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Ross:</b> Sorry.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(Ross gestures his consent.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search
the room.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Rachel?!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Waitress:</strong> Can I get you some coffee?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, sure!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Hi. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens.&nbsp; He sits
back down defeated again.&nbsp; A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others
expect her to explain.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked
familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I
doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where
to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I
knew who lived here in the city.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Who wasn't invited to the wedding.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV
and are trying to figure out what is going on.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Chandler:</b> (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?&nbsp; Decide!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Ross:</b> (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">(The scene on TV has changed to show two
women, one is holding her hair.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Phoebe:</b>&nbsp; If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off.</font> </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I say push her down the stairs. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and <b>Joey:</b></strong>&nbsp;
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> You can see where he'd have trouble.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">[Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...<font color="#0000FF">something and noodles with
string.&nbsp; These are a few...</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> I'm all better now.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.<font color="#0000FF">&nbsp; The whole,
'hat' thing.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> What, like there's a rule or something?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong><b>Paul:</b></strong> (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> <font color="#0000FF">Oh God, is it
6:30?&nbsp; </font>Buzz him in!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Who's Paul?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Maybe. <b>Joey:</b> Wait. Your 'not a real
date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> He finally asked you out?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yes!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Rach, wait, I can cancel...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Please, no, go, that'd be fine!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (choked voice) That'd be good...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (horrified) Really?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Phoebe:</b> What does that mean? &nbsp;
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.</font></p>

was it?</font></p>

just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Monica:</b> Change!&nbsp; Okay,
sit down. </font>(Shows Paul in) Two seconds.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good.</font></p>

really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Monica:</b> (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">It's been kinda a long day.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Okay, sure.</font></p>

understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
&nbsp; <strong>You</strong>, however have had the love of a woman for four years. &nbsp;
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!&nbsp; I don't think that was my point!</font></p>

there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!</font></p>

you gonna say?</font></p>

I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. </font></p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about
now. (He enters.) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not
comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She is so great! I miss her. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What does she mean by 'involved'? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them
tomorrow. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So what are you gonna do? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. </p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking,
or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. </p>

thousand dollars is a lot of money! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No it's not. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have
been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were
just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... </p>

<p>[Time Lapse.]</font></p>

you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,
here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant
with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's
gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too
terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give
Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... </p>

all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! </p>

imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is

<p><b>Monica:</b> 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So when do we get to meet the guy? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Let's see, today's Monday... Never. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh, come on! Come on! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. Not after what happened with Steve. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..
Sorry. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance
to figure that out. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, then can we meet him? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nope. Schhorry. </p>

<p>[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and
within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the
weak members of the herd. </p>

<p><b>Paula:</b> Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll
tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just
looking out after you. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually
liked. </p>

<p><b>Paula:</b> Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if
they never get to meet the guy.. </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Let it go, Ross. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you all promise? </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good? </p>

<p>(Chandler makes a 'Cross my heart' sign.&nbsp; It starts to rain and he taps on the
window.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! </p>

<p>(Chandler sulkilty picks up a garbage can lid and uses it as an umbrella.)</p>

<p>(Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without
saying hi.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, Pheebs. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have
credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and
hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -<i>football phone</i> as our free gift.'
Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What bank is this? </p>

<p>(The intercom buzzes.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it? </p>

<p><strong>Alan: </strong>(on the intercom) It's Alan. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here! </p>

<p>(Chandler comes in, dripping wet.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to all) Okay, please be good, <i>please</i>. Just remember how much you
all like me. </p>

<p>(She opens the door and Alan enters.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. </p>

<p><b>Alan:</b> Hi. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hi, Alan. </p>

<p><b>Alan:</b> I've heard schho much about all you guyschh! </p>

<p>(Everyone laughs.)</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Alan is leaving.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay.
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? </p>

<p>(Silence.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> C'mon! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I
can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Loved him! Yeah! He's great! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that <i>I'm</i> going out
with? </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.) </p>

<p><strong>The Guys:</strong> (reluctantly) Yeah. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...What shoe? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked
smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' </p>

<p>(Dubious pause.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future
boyfriends will be measured. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.
You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You know what I like most about him, though? </p>

<p><b>All:</b> What? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The way he makes me feel about myself. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah... </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.. how was the game? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well.. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Alan. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where
Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base-... </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about
softball.. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..
sometimes.. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> ..I dunno, a little too Alan? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I personally could have a gallon of Alan. </p>

<p>[Scene: A street, Phoebe walks up to a homeless person (Lizzie) she knows.] </p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Hey, Weird Girl. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I brought you alphabet soup. </p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Did you pick out the vowels? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, &quot;sometimes y&quot;. Uh,
I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.) </p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Saltines? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? </p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there's
really money in here. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. </p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Weird Girl, what are you doing? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. </p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> No, no, I ha-I have to give you something. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, that's fine, no. </p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Would you like my tin-foil hat? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? </p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Okay. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. </p>

of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray.&nbsp; He
types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette.
&nbsp; While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a
squirt of air freshener and gags.]</p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I'm fine. </p>

<p><b>Lizzie:</b> (leaves) See ya. </p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is telling everyone about her discovery.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> A <i>thumb</i>?! </p>

<p>(Phoebe nods.) </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Eww! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitch-hiker! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does, um, anyone wanna see? </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Nooo! </p>

<p>(Chandler lights a cigarette.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's worse than the thumb! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, this is so unfair! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, why is it unfair? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with
that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those
flaws, why can't you accept me for this? </p>

<p>(An awkward silence ensues.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I-I could live without it. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her
hair? </p>

<p>(Phoebe spits out her hair.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, (Imitating Ross) &quot;you do, do you&quot;? </p>

<p>(Monica laughs and snorts.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> &quot;Indeed there isn't&quot;... I should really get back to work. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. </p>

<p>(They degenerate into bickering and Chandler happily starts to smoke, undisturbed.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are working.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? </p>

<p><b>Paula:</b> No. </p>

<p><b>Paula:</b> Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got
through! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel <i>the thing</i>.
I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. </p>

<p><b>Paula:</b> Honey.. you should always feel <i>the thing</i>. Listen, if that's how
you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.. it's gonna be really hard. </p>

<p><b>Paula:</b> Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. </p>

<p>[Scene: Cental Perk, Joey and Ross are persecuting Chandler about his smoking.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do you have any respect for your body? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your
emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to
speak to you. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she
told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's
not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that
before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.) </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> If only he were a woman. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. </p>

<p>(They give each other a dubious look.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyond except Monica and Joey is watching Lambchop.] </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for
thirty years it'd be talking too. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey. Where's Joey? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was
wrong? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I think he's across the hall. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I might! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars
for the thumb. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> You're kidding. Oh my God. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the
universe?! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going
on? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, Joey.. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (turns off the TV) Okay.. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh! That was Lambchop! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Please, guys, we have to talk. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, wait, I'm getting a <i>deja vu</i>...no, I'm not. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, we have to talk. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> There it is! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I
mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. </p>

<p>(They all gasp and clutch each other.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is there somebody else? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We didn't change.. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So that's it? It's over? Just like that? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about
someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, I- I could go on pretending- </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It
wouldn't be fair to you! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they
were. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry.. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming
up- I wanted him to meet my family- </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. </p>

that's, that's my puck. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Kid:</strong> I found it. Finders keepers, losers

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, all six are there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's
one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm
concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on! You guys can pee standing up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want.
You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean
things, and then not even care.</p>

<p>(Long pause.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Multiple orgasms!</p>

<h3 align="center">Opening Credits</h3>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, all are there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,
Sat-ur-day night!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No plans, huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Not a one.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, right, right, shut up.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting
there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage
to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Tony?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I
don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey
pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That guy, he burns me up.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He
called me <i>young lady</i>.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did he give you that whole &quot;You're-not-up-to-this&quot; thing
again?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three
choruses of &quot;You'll never make it on your own&quot;.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>(Angela, a beautiful woman in a tight dress, enters.)</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> Hi, Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> My god, Angela.</p>

<p>(Angela takes a seat at the counter.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Are you gonna go over there?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to
her) Hey, Angela. </p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> (casually) Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You look good.</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You don't say.</p>

<p>(Cut to Ross and Rachel, talking next to one of the tables.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry
there too?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you
both, here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Don't you have a laundry room in your building?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat
problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but
they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure.</p>

<p>(Cut back to Joey and Angela at the counter.)</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Bob? Who the hell's Bob?</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.
You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like,
talking too.</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> We're just friends.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together
tonight? You know, as friends?</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> What four of us?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment, Joey is there, trying to convince Monica to pose
as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela's boyfriend Bob and then take
Angela back for himself.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's
smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and
call myself an actor, but Bob is...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (looking out window) Oh, god help us.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe
Angela will come back to me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up
with her. Will you help me? Please?</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross' apartment, Chandler is over.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna
be me and Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing
through?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're
going on a date.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nuh-uh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yuh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the
first time she's gonna see your underwear&#151;you want it to be dirty?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sheepish) No.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my <em>Snuggles</em>? What, it says I'm a
sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something
else up on the way.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There you go.</p>

<p>[Scene: A fancy restaurant, Joey and Monica are there, meeting Angela and Bob, who
Monica thinks is Angela's brother.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Which?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Which what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You've never met Bob, have you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, but he's...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...</p>

<p>(Angela and Bob walk in. Bob is good-looking.)</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> Hey, Joey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Phoebe are there, both ready to break up with their
significant others.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where are they? Where are they?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some
puppies.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Eww, I don't wanna do that.</p>

<p>(Janice and Phoebe's boyfriend, Tony, walk in.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here we go.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, have a good break-up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Janice.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful
day.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here,
please?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the
little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day,
and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking,
I'm looking, I got you...</p>

<p>(Chandler sees Phoebe breaking up with Tony. She talks to him for a few seconds, hugs
him, and then he leaves. Chandler is amazed how easy it was for her.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (covering) What... did you get me there? </p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can
wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match,
moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's great. </p>

<p>(The drinks arrive, and Chandler downs his espresso in one gulp.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine.</p>

<p>(Chandler walks over to the counter where Phoebe is, and is asking her about the
break-up.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, it was really hard.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, you weren't there.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Launderama, Rachel is there, waiting for Ross. An old woman takes Rachel's
clothes off the machine and begins loading it with her things.]</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Comin' through. Move, move.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But I saved it. I put my basket on top.</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I
don't see suds.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> No suds, no save. Ok?</p>

<p>(Ross arrives.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's goin' on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Was your basket on top?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but, there were no suds.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you know, no suds, no save.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's
machine.</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. </p>

<p>(The woman and Ross stare at each other. Finally she takes her stuff out of the machine
and leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see
here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do
you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.</p>

<p>(Ross pulls out a huge box of laundry detergent.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> <i>Uberveiss</i>. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.</p>

<p>(Rachel starts to load her clothes.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed
to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, have you never done this before?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you
wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third
for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these
are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.</p>

<p>[Scene: Fancy restaurant, Monica, Joey, Angela, and Bob are seated at the table.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow
up?</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> Brooklyn Heights.</p>

<p><b>Bob:</b> Cleveland.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How, how did that happen?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my god.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.</p>

<h3 align="center">Commercial Break</h3>

<p>[Scene: Fancy restaurant, Joey and Bob are talking.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So, you and Angela, huh?</p>

<p><b>Bob:</b> Yep. Pretty much.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute
nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.</p>

<p><b>Bob:</b> Huh, I never really noticed.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.</p>

<p><b>Bob:</b> Monica, Monica is great.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.</p>

<p>[Scene: The ladies' bathroom at the restaurant, Monica and Angela are talking.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> Yeah, isn't he?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an
emotional age beyond, like eight.</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.</p>

<p><b>Angela:</b> Huh. That's nice.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is coaching Chandler on how to break up with Janice.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it
really fast, and then the wound is exposed.</p>

<p>(Chandler walks back to couch, where Janice is.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out
anymore. Janice.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and begins
to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it.</p>

<p>[Scene: The laundromat.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can
do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had
to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm
sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What uh-oh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's
a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, what's the matter?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on, show me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your
whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, everything's pink.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please
don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big
marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my
own! I can't even do laundry!</p>

<p>(The woman who had tried to steal the washing machine walks by, and laughs.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The fancy restaurant, Angela has her hand in Bob's shirt, and Monica is very
uncomfortable.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to
inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just
thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could
we check it in the light, please? </p>

<p>(Her and Joey walk away from the table.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my god.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on, they're close.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's&#151;not really true, is
it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my god, what were you thinking?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (hits him lightly) Oh! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ow!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (leaving) I'm outta here.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us,
we can break them up.</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Monica accidentally spilled her drink on Bob's shirt and is wiping it off.
Joey is making eyes at Angela.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.</p>

<p>(Angela is eating chicken wings and making the weasel-like noise Joey had told Bob
about.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is still trying to ease things over with Janice, and
there are about a dozen empty Espresso cups in front of him. He is extremely wired.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out
and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Ow!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.</p>

<p>(She leaves.) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the
worst break-up in the history of the world. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you
had?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I don't know, a million?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. </p>

<p>(Janice returns from the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not fine. Here she comes.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait here. Breathe.</p>

<p>(Phoebe goes over to speak to Janice. She talks to her for a few seconds, and then
Janice immediately smiles, hugs her, waves to Chandler, and leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How do you do that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's like a gift.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We should always always break up together.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I'd like that.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Launderama. Rachel is sorting her now-pink clothes.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.</p>

<p>(The same woman walks over and takes Rachel's laundry cart.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get
outta my way.</p>

<p>(Rachel looks at Ross, who motions to her to get the cart back.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Let go!</p>

<p>(They struggle for the cart. Finally, Rachel climbs inside of it.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to
take me with it! </p>

<p>(She thinks it over, and then walks away.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I could not have done this without you.</p>

<p>(Rachel stands up and kisses Ross. He is stunned. A moment of silence follows.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on
an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

head.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, are you sure you're ok?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Does it still hurt?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm
gonna do this.</p>

<p>(Monica and Joey enter.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, how'd it go?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Excellent.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Where's Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, he needed some time to grieve.</p>

<p>(Chandler runs by the window outside, joyous.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm free! I'm free!</p>

start.]</p>

picture! This is so exciting!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.
Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...</p>

the cast leaves, the gang all groan and sit down heavily.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> God. I feel violated.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body,
to have something else to do?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is it? Feels like two.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, <b>ten o'clock</b>.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight,
nine, ten o'clock!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. Hel-lo!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short,
fat, bald men!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me.
Blarrglarrghh.'</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh please, could she <strong>be </strong>more out of my league? Ross,
back me up here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He could never get a woman like that in a million years.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you, buddy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with
these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You could do that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'think?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very
aware of my tongue...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> C'mon! C'mon!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> ...Yes?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my
name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> Yes, you said that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say,
what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou,
goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.) </p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> Chandler?</p>

<p>(Joey enters from behind a curtain.&nbsp; The others all talk at once.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whadja think?</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did
with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> (admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play,
man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name
'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the
usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What is it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe
they wanna sign me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Based on <i>this play</i>? ...Based on this play!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone else is there as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, kids. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is...
just a line.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you
haven't asked me how my date went.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the
most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...</p>

<p>(A flashback of Aurora and Chandler on their date in Central Perk is denoted by
italics.)</p>

<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it
to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long,
I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I
rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.</p>

<p></i><b>Chandler:</b> We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or
less.</p>

<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> 'We' would be me and Rick.</p>

<p></i><b>Joey:</b> Who's Rick?</p>

<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> Who's Rick?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> My husband.</p>

<p></i><b>All:</b> Ooooohhh.</p>

<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so you're divorced?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> No, I'm still married.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you
sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change
in my pocket?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay
with Ethan.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.</p>

<p></i><b>All:</b> What?!</p>

<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do
you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> I suppose mainly sexual.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...Hm.</p>

<p></i><b>Monica:</b> Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you
listen to the story?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you
get involved with a woman like this?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I
look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and <b>none</b>
of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out
with someone else?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I couldn't do it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Good for you, Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> When I'm with a woman, I need to <em>know</em> that I'm going out with
more people than she is.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean,
anthropologically speaking-</p>

<p>(They all pretend to fall asleep.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! C'mon!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-</p>

<p>(They all fall asleep again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as enter except Joey enter.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Tah-daaah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all
the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't
know what that's for.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, whaddya think?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Uh-oh...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How-how did that happen?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an
extra seat around the coffee table.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see
what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see.
Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll
scratch your eyes right out.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You guys, I am not that bad!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a
little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That is so unfair!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that
wasn't raggedy!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but
you don't pay it right away.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I could do that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent,
but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a
cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and
closer to the surface of the wood...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica? You're Mom.</p>

<p>(Monica gasps.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!</p>

<p>(Joey enters and he's on the phone.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He
hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has
just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh my God! Whoah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, what's the part?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor!
&quot;I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of
order!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Seriously, what-what's the part?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> &quot;Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> ...I'm his (mumbles)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes
into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's
big!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after
all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into
showbusiness.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big
opening?</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</p>

<p></b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Monica is getting the door.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, alright, alright... </p>

<p>(Joey enters with Monica's paper and hands it to her.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> For what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whaddya think? Today's the big day!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't
ever tell me what you did in there.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)</p>

<p>(Chandler enters with the phone.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs
back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I warned you...</p>

<p>(Rachel enters from her room.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who is being loud?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things,
Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you got the whole night, huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He
starts to raid the fridge.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a
relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your
life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about
thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
(He has armloads of stuff.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind
you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. </p>

<p>(She opens the door and he leaves.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A Film Set, Joey is entering for his scene.]</p>

Okay, everybody ready?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.</p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Lose the robe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Me?</p>

<p><b>Director:</b> That would work.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is
lost.</p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll
it.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action.</p>

<p>(Joey starts to the shower with a grim, determined look on his face.)</p>

<p><b>Director:</b> And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I'm- I'm showering.</p>

<p><b>Director:</b> No, that was clenching.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his
wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.</p>

<p><b>Director:</b> I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again,
rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> God, I love these fingers...</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they
are.</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> (moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She
starts to get up.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her
back down.)</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> Okay. Oh no, I have to.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> (getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> It's not Rick.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> No, it's-it's Andrew. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret
asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> He's... new.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick,
Ethan and myself?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> No, that's not exactly what I was..</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> So what do you want?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You.</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> You have me!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nono, just you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Lose the other guys.</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> ...Like, ...all of them?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> C'mon, we're great together, why not?</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and
laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I
thought that's what you wanted too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys,
y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy.
Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out!
Get out!'</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly
let each other finish...</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> Which one?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...The second guy.</p>

<p><b>Aurora:</b> (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.</p>

Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?</p>

Pacino movie?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No? What happened, big guy?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) &quot;Big guy?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It felt like a 'big guy' moment.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I got fired.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now
everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> My mom will.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally
get my shot, and I blow it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Maybe this wasn't your shot.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's
your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hard to tell, I was naked.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you
just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've
gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go
'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)</p>

<p>(Ross and Chandler look at each other and hug as well.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Night.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (determined) Uh-huh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her
room.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She <strong>is </strong>a kook.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) <em>If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have
to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them,

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is introducing Phoebe, who is playing her guitar for the
crowd.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music
of Miss Phoebe Buffay.</p>

<p>(applause)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you
suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights
go out) OK, thank you very much.</p>

<p>[Scene: The ATM vestibule of a bank, Chandler is inside. The lights go out, and he
realizes he is trapped inside.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, <b>great</b>. This is just...</p>

<p>(Chandler sees that there is a gorgeous model inside the vestibule with him. He makes a
gesture of quiet exuberance.)</p>

<h3 align="center">Opening Credits</h3>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone with her mother. Phoebe, Rachel,
and Ross are there.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they
have no idea when it's coming back on.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, you guys, this is big.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a
blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs
up)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my
grandma. (to Monica) What's my number? </p>

<p>(Monica and Rachel look at Phoebe strangely.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I never call <b>me</b>.</p>

<p>[Scene: ATM vestibule, Jill Goodacre is on the cellular phone. Chandler's thoughts are
in italics.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something...
something Goodacre.</p>

<p></i><b>Jill:</b> (on phone) Hi Mom, it's Jill.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in
an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! </i>(pause)<i> Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an
atrium. Oh, yeah, <b>that</b> is the part to focus on, you idiot!</i></p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> (on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM
vestibule.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.</i></p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> (on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last
night. Yes, he was <b>some guy</b>. </i></p>

<p>(Chandler strides proudly across the vestibule and Jill stares at him.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica's apartment, Joey enters with a menorah, the candles lit.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi everyone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we
have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.</p>

<p>(They all look at the window, grossed out, then flinch in pain.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That had to hurt!</p>

<p>[Scene: ATM vestibule.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes
and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!</i></p>

<p>(Chandler smiles at her, she smiles back sweetly.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>There you go!</i></p>

<p>(He continues to smile like an idiot, and she looks frightened.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>You're definitely scaring here.</i></p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> (awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.</i> Yeah, thanks.
(takes phone)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, The phone rings; it's Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, it's me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an
ATM vstbl wth <b>Jll Gdcr</b>.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth <b>Jll Gdcr</b>!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I have no idea what you just said.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (angry) Put Joey on the phone.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What's up man?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth <b>JLL GDCR</b>.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill
Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time has passed. The five are sitting around the coffee
table talking.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Alright, somebody.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Whoooaa!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's my sister.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second
floor of the New York CIty public library.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, what about you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh... Milwaukee.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um... Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'</p>

<p><b>All:</b> No way!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those
mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return
to the Magic Kingdom.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh come on, I already went.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You did not go!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Come on.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the
foot of the bed. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Step back.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We have a winner!</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Ross and Rachel are talking, Joey is on the couch, and Monica and Phoebe
are out of the room.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know,
where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf
course. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having
that kind of...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're
left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So,
you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that
other good stuff.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sigh) OK.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You don't.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mmmm.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I do.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)</p>

<p>(Ross gets up, pleased with himself.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's never gonna happen.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (innocently) What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You and Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the <b>friend
zone</b>. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross, you're mayor of the zone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean,
every day I get just a little bit closer to...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're
thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him)
What? What, now?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight?
You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the
room behind them)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Shhhh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you shushing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.
(everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ahhhh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> See?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)</p>

<p>[Scene: ATM vestibule.]</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> Would you like some gum?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Um, is it sugarless?</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> (checks) Sorry, it's not.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, then no thanks. <i>What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill
Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take
it.</i></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica's apartment, Phoebe is singing.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But
to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she
writes the lyrics down)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Joey) OK, here goes.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you going to do it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm going to do it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do you want any help?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You come out there, you're a dead man.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good luck, man.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)</p>

<p>(Monica walks in, starts to go out on the balcony.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, where are you going?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Outside.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You can't go out there.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Because of... the reason.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And that would be?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I, um, can't tell you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, what's going on?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told
you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> About what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He's planning your birthday party.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! I love him!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> About what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> My surprise party!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What surprise party?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh stop it. Joey already told me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he didn't tell me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, you are not. We tell you stuff.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the
peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was
moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks
like I was second to last.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Ross and Rachel are talking.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hmmm... this is so nice.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, yes, that's right...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!</p>

<p>[Cut to inside. Monica, Joey and Phoebe are singing while outside, Ross and Rachel are
trying to get the cat off of Ross' shoulder.]</p>

<p><strong>Monica, Joey, and</strong> <b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) <i>I'm on top of the world,
looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found
ever since...</i></p>

<h3 align="center">Commercial Break</h3>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is holding the cat, Monica is treating the
scratches on Ross' back. Joey is holding the menorah over the wound.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.</p>

<p>(Ross flinches in pain.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sorry, that was wax.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> During a blackout? He'd get trampled!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (nonchalantly) Yeah?</p>

<p>[Scene: ATM vestibule.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him
a stick of gum, and a strange look) <i>'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be
perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no,
no. For me, gum is <b>perfection</b>. I loathe myself.</i></p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway of Monica's building. Phoebe and Rachel are trying to find the
cat's owner.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,
right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found
this cat and we're looking for the owner.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> Er, yeah, it's mine.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you
sure?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait a minute. What's his name?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> Ehhhh... B-Buttons.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Bob Buttons?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> (as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel has gone off on her own to look for the cat's owner.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little
kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...</p>

<p>(While looking at the floor for the cat, Rachel runs into a pair of legs. She slowly
gets up and sees a gorgeous Italian hunk holding the cat. Who, by the way, you'll hate
very, very soon. The man. Not the cat.)</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> (something Italian)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Monica, and Joey are playing <i>Monopoly</i>.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (rolling) Lucky sixes....</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I
want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (smitten) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And Joey....</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And Ross.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> (something in Italian)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (proudly) He doesn't speak much English.</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> (pointing at game) <em>Monopoly</em>! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look at that!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh... Italy, I think.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him.</p>

<p>(Phoebe enters.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty
anywhere.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since
nobody told me... this is Paolo.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> (something in Italian, he is apparently attracted to Phoebe)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (smiling) You betcha!</p>

<p>[Scene: ATM vestibule.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (chewing gum) <i>Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's
good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.</i></p>

<p>(Chandler waits until Jill is looking, then starts to blow a bubble. But instead of
blow one, he accidentally spits the gum out of his mouth and hits the wall.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and
put it in my mouth.</i> (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in
his mouth.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...</i> (grimacing) <i>..chewing
someone else's gum. <b>This is not my gum</b>. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're
choking.</i> </p>

<p>(Chandler starts to choke.)</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> Are you alright?</p>

<p>(Chandler tries to save face and makes the 'OK' sign with his hands, while obviously
unable to breathe.)</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum
flies from his mouth) That better?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> Perfection?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Paolo are at the window. Ross and Joey are
watching disgustedly.]</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> (something romantic in Italian about Rachel and the stars)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....</p>

<p>(Rachel walks away from Paolo, laughing.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wha-What did he say that was so funny?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I have absolutely no idea.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's... that's classic.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I
doing? This is so un-me!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> If you want, I'll do it.</p>

<p>(Ross looks at Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I
won't.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more
exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at
her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing
in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....</p>

<p>[Cut to the other side of the apartment, Ross has gone over to straighten things out
with Paolo.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Paolo. Hi.</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Ross!</p>

<p>(Ross notices that Paolo is standing on a step, which makes him taller. Ross gets up on
the same step so he can look down at Paolo.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I...
we're kind of a thing.</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Thing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thing, yes. Thing.</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Ah, you... have the sex?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see,
that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together.
You know, and if you get in the.... um... </p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Bed?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... <b>way</b>,
of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! <i>Se vice</i>?</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Si.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So you do know a little English.</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Poco... a leetle.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you know the word <i>crapweasel</i>?</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!</p>

<p>(They hug.)</p>

<p>[Scene: ATM vestibule, Chandler and Jill are sitting below the counter with two pens
dangling from their chains in front of them. Jill is showing Chandler how to swing the pen
around his head.]</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK.</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> Ready? (she swings the pen around her head in a circle)</p>

<p>(Chandler tries to do the same thing but the pen hits him in the head.)</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> No, you've got to whip it. </p>

<p>(He swings the pen hard, and it snaps back and almost hits him again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is all sitting around the table.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...
(time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room
gets completely dark)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Kinda... spooky without any lights.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!</p>

<p>(Everyone starts to imitate him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...</p>

<p>(The lights come back on, and Rachel and Paolo are making out. Ross clutches his
chest.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.. oh... oh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have
to throw a party for Monica.</p>

<h3 align="center">Closing Credits</h3>

<p>[Scene: ATM vestibule, the power has come back on.]</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> Well, this has been fun.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my
life.</p>

<p><b>Jill:</b> Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the
cheek) See ya.</p>

<p>(She leaves. Chandler presses his face to the glass door after her, stroking the window
lovingly. He then turns to the security camera and starts talking to it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got
any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.</p>

Shelley enters.)<b><br>
<br>
Shelley:</b> Hey gorgeous, how's it going?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it <b>get</b>
better than this?</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody
who would be perfect for you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or
'self-destructive'...</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> Do you want a date Saturday?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes please.</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He's a he?</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna
go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye...</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that
ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,
possibly, you might be... </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You did?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my
breasts, so then I figured maybe not.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first
met me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I did.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I think so, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Not me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor
did.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I
told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...</p>

<p>(Joey congratulates Ross, sees Chandler's look and abruptly stops.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! Right!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> WHAT IS IT?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yes. Absolutely. A quality.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be
vague about this.</p>

<p>(Phone rings; Monica gets it)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) <i>Bon giorno, caro mio.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to
Rome.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to
Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and
Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, uh, how's she doing?</p>

<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> The doctor says it's a matter of hours.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How-how are you, Mom?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> What's different?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh, maybe that's it.</p>

<p>(Monica strides over to Ross, who is making coffee, and talks to him aside.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> She is unbelievable, our mother is...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and
we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God!</p>

<p>(They hug.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the hospital, later. Everyone is talking about Nana.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'
Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Not just restaurants, from our house.</p>

<p>(The nurse comes out of Nana's room.)</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> Mrs. Geller?</p>

<p>(Everyone stands up. Cut to Ross and Monica in Nana's room.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She looks so small. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Bye, Nana. </p>

<p>(He goes to kiss her but she moves. Monica screams. Ross shouts and stares in
disbelief. Monica runs out of the room.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross!</p>

<p>(Ross runs out too.)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> What is going on?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,
quite..</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She's not- past, she's present, she's back.</p>

<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> (reentering) What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> She may have died.</p>

<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> She <b>may</b> have died?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> We're looking into it.</p>

<p>(Monica returns with the nurse and they go into Nana's room.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> This almost never happens!</p>

<p>(Nana passes for the second time and the nurse pulls the blanket over her. Ross and
Monica go to tell the family)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> <b>Now</b> she's passed.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey, and Rachel are there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, you have homosexual hair.</p>

<p>(Monica and Ross enter.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, um, did she...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Twice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Twice?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, that sucks!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,
uh...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nono, she's gone.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We checked. A lot.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every
now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand
around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And
Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf
course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little
yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're
dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,
huh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the
pencil)</p>

<p>[Scene: Nana's house, Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!</p>

<p>(They open a cupboard which, amongst other things, contains a chest of drawers)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Sweetie, you think you can get in there?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastic) I don't see why not.</p>

<p>(He tries pushing against the chest of drawers. Then he opens one of the drawers and
climbs into the closet using that; he falls behind the chest of drawers with a shout.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Here's my retainer!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is talking to her father.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I was just thinking. When my time comes-</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Dad!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You what?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Define fun.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so
predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's probably what they'll say.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I'd like that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's Office, Shelley is drinking coffee; Chandler enters.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, gorgeous.</p>

<p><b>Shelley: </b>(sheepish) Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other
people have made the same mistake.</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> Oh! Okay! Phew! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, uh... what do you think it is about me?</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...Quality, right, great.</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great
couple.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> What? He's cute!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> Is Brian...?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with
someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.</p>

<p><b>Shelley:</b> Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could <b>get</b>
a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.</p>

<p>[Scene: Nana's Bedroom, Ross is holding a dress out from inside the closet.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?</p>

<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend
eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.</p>

<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong
one.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)</p>

<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> Wait! We need shoes!</p>

<p>(Ross falls back inside)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> That's really a day shoe.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?</p>

<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> Could we see something in a slimmer heel?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
I can show you something in a silver that may work.</p>

<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> No, it really should be burgundy.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.</p>

<p>(He finds a shoebox (out of shot), pulls it down and opens it. It is full of <em>Sweet
'n' Lo</em>'s.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God..</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Is everything all right, dear?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.</p>

<p>(He reaches up higher and knocks down another shoebox lid. <em>Sweet 'n' Lo</em>'s rain
down on him)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are preparing to leave for the funeral.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did
you know my ears are not my best feature?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Some days it's all I can think about. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you-you mean your earrings?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What'd I say?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are these the shoes?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't
it?</p>

<p>(They all leave.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The cemetary, after the funeral.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It was a really beautiful service.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y'know, I think
it might be time for you to start using night cream.</p>

<p>(Joey listens to his overcoat for a second and sighs, then notices Chandler watching)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're watching a football game at a funeral?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You are a frightening, frightening man.</p>

<p>(Rachel steps in a patch of mud)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I hope they're not ruined.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's,
there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he
falls into an open grave)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> God! Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...</p>

<p>[Scene: The Wake, at the Gellers' house. Ross is lying on his back, with Phoebe
squatting over him, checking to see if he's injured.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in
spasm...huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, what is it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You missed a belt loop. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! No-n-</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, it's in spasm.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
(Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)</p>

<p>(Cut to Chandler and a woman, Andrea, reaching for the same slice of meat)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no-</p>

<p><b>Andrea:</b> Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.</p>

<p>(They shake hands. Cut to Ross emerging from a hallway, grinning inanely. He is
obviously very stoned)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, those pills really worked, huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys
are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! That's so nice...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...Chandler! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to
me.</p>

<p><b>Andrea:</b> (turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.</p>

<p><b>Rachel: </b>(humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)</p>

<p>(Cut to Joey watching TV in the corner. He makes an extravagant gesture of
disappointment.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Whaddya got there?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing
disability.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> What's the score?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)</p>

<p>(Time lapse. A large crowd of men are now watching the game)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller: </b>(to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?',
I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting
your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That sounds like Nana.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> ...I can imagine.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the
positive, life-affirming person that she is.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all
over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Tell her what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your
hair... for example.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the
truth?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's
nicer when people just get along. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> More wine, dear?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I think so.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises)
Those earrings look really lovely on you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. They're yours.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Actually they were Nana's.</p>

<p>(There is a cry of disappointment from the crowd of men.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the gang are looking at old photos.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, who's this little naked guy?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That little naked guy would be me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aww, look at the little thing.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Who are those people?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Got me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Lowell.</p>

<p><b>Lowell: </b>Hey, Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So how's it going there in Financial Services?</p>

<p><b>Lowell: </b>It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,
uh... I'm not.</p>

<p><b>Lowell:</b> I know. That's what I told her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>Lowell:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So- you can tell?</p>

<p><b>Lowell:</b> Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you don't think I have a, a quality?</p>

<p><b>Lowell:</b> Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend
Brian from Payroll, he is.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He <b>is</b>?</p>

<p><b>Lowell:</b> Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I
wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.</font></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is confronting her boss, Terry.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was
wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?</p>

<p><b>Terry:</b> An advance?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we
go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the
whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.</p>

<p><b>Terry:</b> Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really,
really awful.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm
trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?
(everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.</p>

<h3 align="center">Opening Credits</h3>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is approaching a customer.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do
you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?</p>

<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.
(picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go. </p>

<p>(Monica enters.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for
Thanksgiving?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, they're not.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're wrong.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I am not wrong.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're wrong.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, I just talked to them.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.</p>

<p>(Joey enters. His face looks abnormally colorful.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey
Tribbiani, man slash woman.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What were you modeling for?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You know those posters for the city free clinic?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those &quot;healthy, healthy, healthy
guys&quot;?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, the asthma guy was really cute.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do you know which one you're gonna be?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good luck, man. I hope you get it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p>(Ross comes back to the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's
Thanksgiving. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make
it just like Mom's.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her
sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim
holidays.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, every single one of them.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December
'cause he is lunar.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So you're free Thursday, then.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Oh, can I come?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I thought it was $98.50.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I'm off to Carol's.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to
bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol and Susan's apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi, is uh, is Carol here?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> No, she's at a faculty meeting.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...<b>Susan:</b>
Come in.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to
the museum.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> What's it look like?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Kinda like a big face without skin.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about
bein' a lesbian.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you
do it. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...
crazy?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you uh, do you talk about me?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Yeah, yeah, all the time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly
time too. Not that I believe any of this.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can
show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,
and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,
I'd very much like to butter your head.</p>

<p>(Rachel enters.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rach, did you make your money?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,
shoop, shoop.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, here's your mail.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks, you can just put it on the table.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (insistently) No, here's your mail.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks, you can just put it on the table.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?</p>

<p>(Rachel opens it. Inside is the money she needed.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We all chipped in.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Monica) We did?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you. Thank you so much!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional
Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family
size bag of Funyuns.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving
dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, I'm nine years old.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I hate this story.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I
remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents
choose to tell me they're getting divorced.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my god.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once
you've seen it in reverse.</p>

<p>[Scene: The subway, Joey spots a gorgeous woman waiting. He goes up to her.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.</p>

<p><strong>Girl:</strong> We did?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.
(pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis? </p>

<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.</p>

<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Get out.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.</p>

<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Really? You don't know what that means to me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?</p>

<p><strong>Girl:</strong> (provocatively) Nothing.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?</p>

<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Yeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What's wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Girl:</strong> I just remembered, I have to do something.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. What?</p>

<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Um, leave.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait, wait, wait!</p>

<p>(Joey turns around and sees his face on a poster in the subway. The poster says: What
Mario isn't telling you...V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are
shown with the poster displayed all over New York City.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey enters, amongst snickers from the gang.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So I guess you all saw it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Saw what?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey enters, upset.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tonight, on a very special Blossom.</p>

<h3 align="center">Commercial Break</h3>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is
standing in the doorway, not wanting to participate in the festivities.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are
yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop
moping.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's closer.</p>

<p>(Rachel enters, excited.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,
shoop.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, you must stop shooping.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, will you just come in already?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.</p>

<p>(Phoebe takes a slice of pumpkin pie and waves it in front of Chandler's face.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not
funny anymore.</p>

<p>(Chandler leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's not a question.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little
piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't
be with my family because of my disease.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and
in the form of tots.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. </p>

<p>(Ross grabs for some food, Monica slaps his hand away.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, Mom never hit.</p>

<p>(Ross exits.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (stirring pot) Ok, all done.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then
add some peas and onions.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why would we do that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,
before she died.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and
hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!</p>

<p>(Chandler enters, running.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten
away.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> The balloon?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all
over the news. Right before he reached <em>Macy's</em>, he broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can't, I gotta go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often
does that happen?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Almost never.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Got the keys? <i>or</i> Got the keys!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok.</p>

<p>(Everyone leaves the apartment.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol and Susan's, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly.]</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Anytime you're ready.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I
talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain
acoustical advantage, but...</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Just aim for the bump.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this
is too weird. I feel stupid.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan
does it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the group is coming back from the roof.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the
park.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on
the inside. Why are we standing here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No I don't.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, you do. When we left, you said, &quot;got the keys.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No I didn't. I asked, &quot;got the ke-eys?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, no, you said, &quot;got the keys&quot;.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do either of you <b>have</b> the keys?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (panicked) The oven is on.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I gotta get my ticket!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well then get it, get it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That tone will not make me go any faster.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (angry) Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That one will. </p>

<p>(Joey leaves to get the copy of the key.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol and Susan's, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.
So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's
face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?</p>

<p>(Susan enters.)</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Hi, how's it goin?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Shh! (singing) <em>Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest
looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey</em>! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> I did.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Does it always, uh--?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> No, no that was the first.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Keep singing! Keep singing!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (singing) <em>Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When
you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo</em>.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> I felt it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (singin) <em>Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts</em>.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hallway, Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nope, not that one.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Can you go any faster with that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't
for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a
gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I swear you said you had the keys.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I
obviously didn't have the keys.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.</p>

<p>(Short pause.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why would I have the keys?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aside from the fact that you said you had them?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But I didn't.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you should have.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm
making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of
potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of
potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned,
and, and I... I...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.
Here we go.</p>

<p>(They walk in. Smoke fills the apartment.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes
are ruined, potatoes are ruined.</p>

<p>(Ross enters, singing.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Here we come, walkin' down the&#151;this doesn't smell like Mom's.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan
of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck
here with you guys.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You call that delicious? </p>

<p>(all shouting)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Stop it, stop it, stop it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Now this feels like Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>[Time lapse. Everyone is upset with each other. Phoebe is at the window.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not
alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.</p>

<p>(They all run to the window.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's nice that he has someone.</p>

<p>[Time lapse. The gang is around the table, eating grilled cheese sandwiches.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Shall I carve?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> By all means.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I will.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Make a wish?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd
you wish for?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> The bigger half.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this
isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been
really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with
your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings
sucked.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> That's so sweet.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And a crappy New Year.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here, here!</p>

<h3 align="center">Closing Credits</h3>

<p>[Scene: The Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster,
revealing more posters underneath. The captions read, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Bladder Control Problem<br>
    Stop Wife Beating<br>
    Hemorrhoids?<br>
    Winner of 3 Tony Awards... </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. </p>

<p>(A monkey jumps on to his shoulder.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oooh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> W-wait. What is that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, no, I don't.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why don't you just get a roommate?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is
kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really
cool way to live'.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs
about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Might wanna open with the snowman.</p>

<p>(Enter Joey)</p>

<p><b><b>All:</b></b> Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, how'd it go?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even
jolly, it's all political.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So what are you gonna be?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,
y'know?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all
protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible
pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can
have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so
I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, you wish!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.</p>

<p><b><b>All:</b></b> Yeah, okay. Alright.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. </p>

<p><b><b>All:</b></b> Woooo! Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, you're on.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, oh, good.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular
demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot
to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I made a man with eyes of coal<br>
  And a smile so bewitchin',<br>
  How was I supposed to know<br>
  That my mom was dead in the kitchen?</em><br>
  (shakes bell) <em>La lalala la la la la lalala la la...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Cut to later. Everyone is totally depressed by now.)</p>

<p>(Over the sound of Phoebe singing we hear two scientists, Max and David, having a noisy
discussion)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Sung) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...I feel a little sneezy<br>
  And now I-</em> (abruptly stops) </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! (They stop talking and look up) Is
it something that you would like to share with the entire group?</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> No. No, that's- that's okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then
I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Could you speak up please?</p>

<p><b>David:</b> (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my
friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my
life. And then he said that- you said you thought</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> Daryl Hannah.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life
and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I
thought she had kind of a </p>

<p><b>Max:</b> Hard quality.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional
way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you
started yelling. (Sits down)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my
sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just
share too much?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just a smidge.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think it's romantic.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except
he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the
time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna
ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the
pact.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!</p>

<p>[Joey enters, his shoes have bells on, which jingle as he walks. He is wearing a long
coat.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.</p>

<p>(He removes the coat to reveal an elf costume)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Too many jokes... must mock Joey! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Aah, y'killing me!</p>

<p>(Marcel knocks over some kitchen tools)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you always have to bring him here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this
morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,
and he- he threw some faeces...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're
there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.</p>

<p>[Scene: Max and David's lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a
whiteboard.]</p>

<p><b>David:</b> ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle
accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, alright, I have a question, then. </p>

<p><b>David:</b> Yuh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be
(Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss
that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to
be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I
just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not
really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a
sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Rrrreally.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and
throw me. </p>

<p><b>David:</b> ...Now? Now?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah, right now.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop
computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks
up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. </p>

<p><b>David:</b> Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the
desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can hop. (She hops onto the table)</p>

<p>(They kiss, finally)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has
somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You know more than one Fun Bobby?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I happen to know a Fun Bob.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, four.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Four.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Five.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Five. (Buries his head in his hands)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to
do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball
drops?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's
with who.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What's the matter?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking
around all the time dragging his hands... </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, uh... what juggling thing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a
melon...</p>

<p>(Max runs in)</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> Phoebe. Hi. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> No. Have you seen David?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, he hasn't been around.</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Minsk?</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> Minsk. It's in Russia.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know where Minsk is.</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So when, when do you leave?</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> January first.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Max and David's lab, they are working. Phoebe knocks on the door]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hello?</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice)
congratulations! This is so exciting!</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> It'd be even more exciting if we were going.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and
Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my
girlfriend!!' (Storms out)</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Thank you, Max. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So-so you're really not going?</p>

<p><b>David:</b> I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh don't do that.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Please.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no no.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> No, but I'm asking-</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, but I can't do that-</p>

<p><b>David:</b> No, but I can't-</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's your thing, and-</p>

<p><b>David:</b> -make the decision-</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, um, stay.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Stay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Stay.</p>

<p>(He thinks for a moment and sweeps the stuff off the table)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Getting so good at that! (She hops on)</p>

<p><b>David:</b> It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the party has started.]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet
starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You remember Janice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Vividly.</p>

<p>(Someone knocks on the door; Monica gets it)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Sandy:</b> Hi, I'm Sandy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger
girl)...You brought your kids.</p>

<p><b>Sandy:</b> Yeah. That's okay, right?</p>

<p>(Joey and Monica look at each other and shrug. Ross enters with Marcel on his shoulder)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Par-tay! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That thing is not coming in here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you
something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your
home?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to
have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright. Just keep him away from me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a
little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.</p>

<p>(The door opens. Rachel is standing there. Her coat is muddy and torn, her hair is
dishevelled and her face is bruised. Everyone turns to look)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Rome. Jerk missed his flight.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And then... your face is bloated?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman-
this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her
cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my
hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm
going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my
whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?</p>

<p>[Time lapse. Monica and Rachel, fixed up somewhat, emerge from a bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Sandy:</b> Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first
time I ever mentally undressed an elf.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow, that's, uh, dirty.</p>

<p><b>Sandy:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>(They almost kiss and then Joey realises her kids are staring at them)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, kids...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not
saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (Imitating) But you found me!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts
snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Kill me. Kill me now. </p>

<p>(Someone else knocks on the door. Monica looks through the spyhole)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!</p>

<p>(Everyone cheers. Monica opens the door. Bobby is obviously very depressed)</p>

<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two
hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?</p>

<p>(Monica gestures wildly behind Fun Bobby's back) </p>

<p>[Time lapse. Bobby is talking about his grandfather. Everyone else is virtually in
tears]</p>

<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see
him again.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and
I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I
invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, no. Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm sorry you misunderstood...</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these
times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)</p>

<p>(Ross is still taking photos)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)</p>

<p>(David is feeding Phoebe popcorn. Max walks up)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi, Max!</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>Max:</b> It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Are you alright?</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. </p>

<p>(Phoebe leads David into a bedroom)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You're going to Minsk.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> No, I'm... not going to Minsk.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here
just 'cause of me.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I
can't break up with you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and
that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say
that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you
understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> Uh, ow.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you
put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and
you'll never forget me.</p>

<p><b>David:</b> I'll never forget you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because
you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna
miss you. You scientist guy.</p>

<p><b>Dick Clark:</b> (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a
virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...</p>

<p>(Joey puts a blanket over Sandy's kids)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> There y'go, kids.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me.
(Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You seen Sandy?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's
bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to
tell you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.</p>

<p><strong>All:</strong> (in the kitchen) What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> The bll is drrbing!</p>

<p><b>Dick Clark:</b> (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And the moment of joy is upon us.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!</p>

<p>(Bobby waves and then bursts into tears. Midnight comes and everyone at the party
except for the gang cheers and kisses)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,
but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can't kiss anyone.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So I'm kissing everyone?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody
kiss me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I
mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning
it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you
back.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but
behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of
depression. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.</p>

<p>(The guy walks past them)</p>

<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Nice hat.</p>

<p><strong>Monica and Phoebe: </strong>(in unison) Thanks.</p>

<p>(The guy walks on)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We should do something. Whistle.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We are not going to whistle.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, do it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Do it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Do it do it do it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!</p>

<p>(The guy turns round, startled. Monica points to Phoebe. The guy gets hit by a truck)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can't believe you did that!</p>

<p>[Scene: Hospital, the guy is in a coma and Mon and Pheebs are visiting.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that
he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to
him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe nobody's tried this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even
sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's
artistic.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can
dance!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening,
y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I wish all guys could be like him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Jay Leno:</b> (on TV) Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book,
'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids
to bed for this one.</p>

<p>(Everyone has settled down to watch, except Chandler)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, we don't have to watch this. <em>Weekend At Bernie's</em> is
on <em>Showtime</em>, <em>HBO</em>, and <em>Cinemax</em>.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No way, forget it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> C'mon, she's your mom!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Exactly. <em>Weekend At Bernie's</em>! Dead guy getting hit in the

cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old
and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can say that because she's not your mom.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Last night.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Your mom was arrested?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Shhh, busy beaming with pride.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've
been intimate with a man...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Now why would she say that's embarrassing?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Shhh.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!</p>

<p><b>Jay Leno:</b> (on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how
is that going?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate-
but I get to see my son, who I love...</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Awww!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.</p>

<p><b>Jay Leno:</b> (on TV) Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a
mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first
condoms.</p>

<p>(The gang turn to look at Chandler)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...And then he burst into flames.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hospital, it's a montage of Monica and Phoebe's visit to the hospital with <em>My
Guy</em> playing in the background.&nbsp; It starts with Monica reading a newspaper to
him.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the
mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams
played sports.</p>

<p>[Next is a shot of them dragging an enormous plant into the room, then Monica knitting
a sweater, then Phoebe singing, then Phoebe shaving him and chatting to Monica]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What about Glen? He could be a Glen. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nah... not-not special enough.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! How about Agamemnon?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Waaay too special.</p>

<p>[Scene: A Mexican Restaurant, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and his mom are there.]</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down)
Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know I am.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Who's doing shots?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm in.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> There y'go. Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.</p>

<p>(Enter Rachel and Paolo. They are both somewhat flustered)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of
time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)</p>

<p>[Time lapse. Ross is now clearly drunk. He is holding up a shot glass to his eye like a
jeweller's eye.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Anyone want me to appraise anything?</p>

<p>(Rachel feeds something to Paolo. He eats it and licks her hand)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written.
No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a
writer.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just
start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia,
and bam! You have got yourself a book.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>[Cut to Mrs. Bing on the telephone.]</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Yeah, any messages for room 226?</p>

<p>(Ross emerges from a toilet marked 'Chicas')</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> You okay there, slugger?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and
he tries to pretend he was in the other one)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> What is with you tonight?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It's the Italian Hand-Licker,
isn't it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. It's the one he's licking.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> She's supposed to be with you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're good.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my
books, and y'know why?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages
for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you
eventually kill off.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> When?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> No, it's you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Please.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> You are gonna be fine, believe me.</p>

<p>(She kisses him on the cheek)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-oh...</p>

<p>(...Then full on the mouth)</p>

<p>(Enter Joey)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the next morning. Joey is getting the door in his dressing
gown&#151;it's Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, is Chandler here?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>(Ross drags Joey into the hall and slams the door)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes
his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a
kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Right. No big deal.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What code?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin'
aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!</p>

<p>(Chandler opens the door and startles them. He picks up the paper)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you guys doing out here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning
racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to
bring me one.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside
and shuts the door)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross, how could you let this happen?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know?
She's, she's sexy, she's...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You don't think my mom's sexy?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well... not in the same way...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day,
alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...</p>

<p>(Monica and Rachel's door opens and Rachel and Paolo emerge)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What're you guys doing out here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, not playing raquetball!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He forgot to leave his grip size!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He didn't get the goggles!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well,sounds like you two have issues.</p>

<p>(She and Paolo walk a little way down the hall)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Goodbye, baby.</p>

<p><b>Paolo:</b> Ciao, bela.</p>

<p>(They kiss. Ross is watching them)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Do they wait for me to do this?</p>

<p>(Joey and Ross go into Monica and Rachel's apartment)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So are you gonna tell him?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why would I tell him?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Entering) What are you guys doing here?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> ...What did I ask?</p>

<p>[Scene: Hospital. Phoebe is there stroking Coma Guy's hair, when Monica enters with a
bunch of balloons.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I..
y'know, so what are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my
way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No!
...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How would I know? I-I wasn't here.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to
reveal him wearing new pajamas.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross is talking to Chandler. Joey is making a snack at the
bar.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you
know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I
can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much
tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing
happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Joey) You knew about this?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows
what woulda happened.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks, man, big help.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I wasn't- I mean, I-</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my
mom more than you. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know-</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler-</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Me neither, y'know what-</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm still mad at you for not telling me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you mad at me for?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler-</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See
what happens when you break the code?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey-</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there except for Chandler.&nbsp; Rachel is writing
something and Monica walks up.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now,
do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Going to the hospital tonight?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You just asked me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can
we do this now?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on
their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I cannot believe we're having this conversation.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man
that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look)
'Kay. (Sung:) <i></p>

<p align="left">(She sees Monica sneaking out) Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a
short break! (Runs out, knocking over the mike stand)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!</p>

<p>(Enter Chandler)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What was that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
(Goes to the counter)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I
just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian
nightmare. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!</p>

<p>(People turn to look)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's very funny. We done now?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell
her how you feel?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my
mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his
finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee)
That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Coma Guy's Room, Monica bursts in, closely followed by Phoebe. There is no
sign of Coma Guy.&nbsp; His bed is empty.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Alright, whadyou do with him?</p>

<p>(There is the sound of a flushing toilet and Coma Guy emerges from the bathroom)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh! You're awake!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look at you! How, how do you feel?</p>

<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You look good!</p>

<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> I feel good! ...Who are you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm Phoebe Buffay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, we both have.</p>

<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, actually it's just from me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I got you the foot massager.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know who shaved you? That was me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I read to you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I sang. (To Monica) Hah!</p>

<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> Well,... thanks.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, my pleasure.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> So. I guess I'll see you around.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What, that's it? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> &quot;See you around?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> Well, what do you want me to say?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, &quot;That was nice?&quot; Admit something
to me? &quot;I'll call you?&quot; </p>

<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> Alright, I'll call you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don't think you mean that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then-
we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and &quot;See
you around!&quot; Let's go, Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the
coma.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's Chandler is talking with his mom.]</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of
my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really stupid.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry,
honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. No. No...</p>

<p>[Cut to the hallway, Joey is listening to Chandler and his mom's conversation through
the door as Ross walks up.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about
everything.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're kidding.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no. He said &quot;When are you gonna grow up and start being a
mom?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Then she came back with &quot;The question is, when are you gonna grow up
and realise I have a bomb?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say &quot;When are you gonna
grow up and realise I am your mom?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That makes more sense.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, what's going on now?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to
the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whaddya see?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking
away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!</p>

<p>(Joey runs off down the hall. Ross tries Monica and Rachel's apartment, but it is
locked so he has to stand in the hall and pretend he wasn't listening. Chandler and his
mom come out)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> You okay, kiddo?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Alright. (Kisses him)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nice save.</p>

<p>(She walks down the hall)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Mr. Geller.</p>

<p>(She leaves)</p>

<p>(Ross knocks on Monica and Rachel's door)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You mean that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? How'd it go?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, howdya feel?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pretty good! I told her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your
mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go
down that road.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What's a 'niffle'?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya,

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told
me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no

<p>(Rachel enters with Paolo, speaking Italian. Ross looks annoyed)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching
Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Ah, poke (Paolo touches Rachel's nose) a (touches nose again)
nose, mmm (they rub noses, then kisses her)</p>

<p><strong>Joey, Chandler, and Ross:</strong> (sitting in living room, imitating Paolo)
Mma, Mma, Mmaah</p>

<p>(Camera pans to Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe in the kitchen)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, did I hear Poconos?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, that's a big step.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know...</p>

<p>(Camera pans to Ross, looking dejected)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes
flinging motions with hands) flung by now?</p>

<p>(Camera pans back to Rachel)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things
that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him,
I'm totally, totally...</p>

<p>(Camera pans to Ross, holding his stomach)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call
immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Joey leaving girls' apartment, carrying lasagna.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes,
and their little baby hands... </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!</p>

<p>(Joey opens door, throws keys on kitchen table, table falls over)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Hey hey, come on in!</p>

<p>(Ross enters, carrying lasagna)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends
her love, along with this lasagna. </p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> So, I got the results of the amnio today.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is
everything, uhh....? </p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Totally and completely healthy!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a
picture frame)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Uh, that's our friend Tanya.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friend
Tanya. (looks up frightenedly)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Don't you want to know about the sex?</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough
trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing
hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw...</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> The sex of the baby, Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Do you want to know?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you
know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!
(pauses) Or isn't...</p>

<p>(Susan enters)</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Oh, hello Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Susan...</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> So, so, did you hear?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Oh, that's so... (Susan hugs Carol, they giggle, Ross steps away) It
really is...do we know...?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy
who doesn't want to know, standing right here!</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Mm-hmmm (Susan and Carol hug, giggling. Ross stands back, reaches out and

<p><strong>Carol and Susan</strong><b>:</b> It's a...</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to
know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. </p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Well, thanks for the books.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach,
then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
(intercom buzzer rings)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Hello?</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and
Susan laugh)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's,&nbsp; Joey and Chandler use their knees as a table to
support the lasagna.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's the rule.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How'd you get to that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little
breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You knew about that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left
little to the imagination.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ok, ok, How about if we split it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What do you mean, like, buy it together?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You think we're ready for something like that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to
move out?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why, are you moving out?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not moving out. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You'd tell me if you were moving out right</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Aw, I know all about Kip!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and
got married, and things got pretty ugly.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Aw, don't do that</p>

shiatsu.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe's Assistant:</strong> Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, Racquela's right, yeah!</p>

<p>(Paolo speaks Italian)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Uh, I am, uh, being naked?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know,
to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe is there.]</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I
couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And Monica knows...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and
waves arms frantically in protest)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait&#151;oh&#151;hey&#151;huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, right, that's me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)</p>

<p>(all talking indistinctly, high-fiving)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks Rach.</p>

<p>(Rachel walks away)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So what are you gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as
a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to
chime in)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Feminist issue. That's where I went!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She is gonna hate me.</p>

table)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's patio furniture!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So what, like people are gonna come in and think, &quot;Uh-oh, I'm outside
again?&quot; Of course!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know, birds just don't say, &quot;Hello, sit here, eat
something.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You pick one.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, how about the ladybugs?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine
dining!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a
time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are
the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal
raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie,
overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other
cookies</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've
ever had.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Which proves that I never lie.</p>

Chandler) You suck!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I need some milk.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup)
Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No...<strong>oh</strong>, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other
day with you guys and I was all &quot;Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel
so...&quot; Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, good! Ok...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's
gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, Ok, Pheebs...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, God...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just
liked it better before it was better...</p>

<p>(Phoebe scoots her chair over to Rachel and hugs her)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is telling everyone how it went across the hall as
the foosball game continues.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now,
so...</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching
places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game!
Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your
butts.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there
team.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, two on one.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's
time for you to swoop in!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, now?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out
of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's
not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off
into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...</p>

<p>[Cut to inside the apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) How's it going?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,
now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in
front of her chest), Ok, that is either, &quot;How could you?&quot; or, &quot;Enormous
breasts!&quot; Here he comes! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh!</p>

<p>(Paolo enters. Ross, Phoebe, and Monica scatter)</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, ok bye-bye.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a
lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.</p>

<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Grazie.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I
say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's
not overwhelmed...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you're right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.</p>

<p>[Cut to the balcony, Ross has just climbed through the window.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You all right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, I've been better...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than
him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he
has you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Ross...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want
to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh Ross, you're so great!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)</p>

<p>[Cut to inside the apartment, Rachel and Ross are entering.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You ok?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the
answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated
screening process.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to
figure out what I want</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up
to be one.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (astonished) What? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I-I'm, I'm having a boy?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?</p>

<p><b>Girls:</b> Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!</p>

<p>(Joey and Chandler run in)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wha-</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wha-</p>

<p><b>Joey and Chandler:</b> What is it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oops!</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> But you tell it really well, sweetie.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Okay. I'll miss you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Isn't he great?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's
not too shrinky, y'know?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, you think you'll do it on his couch?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know?
Vinyl.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Did I, uh, did I miss something?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope
and a box of donuts.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice
boobies.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when
the laughter stops.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know,
that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child,
right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uhhuh, how did you know that?</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> It's textbook.</p>

<p>(Joey enters with his dad)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, how long are you in the city?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better
off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) I
don't know this one.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, this is my friend Roger.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Hi. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> You too, sir.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> (To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross whines and lays
his head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something
funny!</p>

<p>(Chandler stays stonefaced)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Mr. Tribbiani is on the phone.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late
now</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.
Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?</p>

<p>(His dad nods. Cut to later. Joey is chopping mushrooms)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the
navy yard and show you the big ships?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Since then?!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory
in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been
in love?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> ...I d'know.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is,
it's with two different women.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is lamenting to everyone about hid dad's affair.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this
double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be
cool.... This blows!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over
near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become
people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Did you not get a good enough look the other day?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve
this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I don't see that happening?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'</p>

<p>(Door buzzer goes)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Intercom) It's Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> (Intercom) And Rog.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> C'mon up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What's the matter with Rog?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,
he's not that bad.</p>

<p>(Cut to Chandler, Ross and Roger sitting at the table. Ross is upset)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on
any level thatthat she was a lesbian?</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for
overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage
your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh! So you think I'm a failure!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Isn't he good?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what
you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!</p>

<p>(Cut to later. Rachel is in tears)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it
was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little
lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. </p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
we gotta get going. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those
cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.</p>

<p>(He shuts the door and Ross and Monica fling cookies at it)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Joey are just leaving Monica and Rachel's.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Night, you guys.</p>

<p>(They notice that a woman is sitting by their door)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm Joey Tribbiani.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your
pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ronni is talking to Chandler. Joey's dad is not around.]</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta
laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a
pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> That's a good one!</p>

<p>(Joey's dad enters.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Hey, Joe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dad, Ronni's here.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd
need it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Thank you. Uh...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, who's up for a big game of <em>Kerplunk</em>?</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss
the last train.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> I don't want you taking that thing.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who-ah-ho.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> We'll go to a hotel.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> (Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No you won't.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> No we won't.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where
I can keep an eye on you.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> You're gonna keep an eye on us?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're
under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your
girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Wow. He's strict.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not
followed by &quot;No thanks, it's late.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a
change. This has gone on long enough.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> What kinda change?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, either you break it off with Ronni</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> I can't do that!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Yeah, but this is</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, night. Chandler and Joey are sharing the sofabed in the
living room. Joey is restless.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you're gonna.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of
girls...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and
go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go
into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that
wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes
along, you will have the courage and the guts to say &quot;No thanks, I'm married.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You really think so?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. I really do.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Get off!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, morning. Someone knocks on the door and Monica gets it.]</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi...May I help you?</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in
ours?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay...who are you?</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, c'mon in.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, I'm Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Bathroom's up there.</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the
shower?</p>

<p><b>Ronni:</b> Oh, like, uh, five minutes?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey
and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Hey. Morning, dear.</p>

<p>(Rachel goes up to the door of their bathroom)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.</p>

<p>(She opens the door and whips back the curtain. It's Joey. They both scream)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I thought it was Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (Comes out of his room) What? What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there as Phoebe enters.]</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey, Pheebs.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How's it going?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite
you guys.</p>

<p>(Chandler laughs)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So what's going on?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I dunno, there's just something about...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Basically we just feel that he's...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We hate that guy.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah. Hate him.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's
so perceptive that it freaks you out?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> ...No, we hate him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We're sorry.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment, Joey is trying to turn the sofabed back into a
sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ma! What're you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this.
(Whacks him round the ear)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oww! Big ring!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that
garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in
there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and
it folds away)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hold on, you-you knew?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James
Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. &quot;I'm sleeping over at my
accountant's,&quot; I mean, what is that? Please!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So then how could you I mean, how could you?!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling,
always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not
those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he
has a hobby.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking
about?! I mean, what about you?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her,
and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive,
he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm...happy...for you?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want
it the way it was.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you
see her?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> That's sweet. Could I take her?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe is there with Roger.]</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> What's wrong, sweetie?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nothing, nothing.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her
head in his lap)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a
liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Oh. They don't.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all
the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Intense and creepy. </p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But I don't. Me, Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You're not? See, that's why you're so great! </p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this
kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally
stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry,
might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love
me, I need love!'.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is letting everyone in on the new developments.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So you talked to your dad, huh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep
pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her
husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with
anything except that I found out today.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So Joey, you okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.
Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing
after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey, Pheebs.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How's it going?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Awww.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Aaawwwwww!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet,
and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Joey. What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
(He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica
in a towel)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sorry. Wrong boobies.</p>

<p>(He leaves. Cut to Monica entering Chandler and Joey's apartment. She sneaks up to the
shower door)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello, Joey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.</p>

talking to the beautiful woman.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You can not do this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do what, do what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright,
still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I
know I do. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out
with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pathetic mess? I know, but&#151;come on, man, she's needy, she's
vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and
eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'
this.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi. She said yes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in
Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?</p>

<p>[Scene: A Restaurant, Joey and Chandler are there, waiting for their dates to show up.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember,
no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.</p>

<p><b>Lorraine:</b> Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...And what did you bring?</p>

<p><b>Lorraine:</b> She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my
hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Janice?</p>

<p>(Lorraine leaves. Joey shakes his head as though to say, 'It can't be the same Janice.'
Janice enters.)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh.... my.... God.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (angrily) Hey, it's Janice.</p>

<p>[Scene: The bathroom at the restaurant, Chandler and Joey are talking.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with
Lorraine. Just calm down. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped
twice in the last five months!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I
can't go when I'm nervous.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and
yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all there, discussing their bad luck with
men.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Which one was Pete Carney?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had
sex. (imitating) &quot;Was it good for you?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over
Howard-the-&quot;I-win&quot;-guy. (imitating) &quot;I win! I win!&quot; I went out with
the guy for two months&#151;I didn't get to win once.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> There's more beer, right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you
want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, well, what kind of ritual?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Or?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Burning's good.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Restaurant, Joey, Lorraine, Chandler, and Janice are at the table. Joey and
Lorraine are seated very close, Chandler and Janice have backed their chairs away from one
another.]</p>

<p><b>Lorraine:</b> You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters
with my toes.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want,
I have a bag with just your heads.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's OK.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little
puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.</p>

<p>(Lorraine whispers into Joey's ear.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Lorraine) We can't do that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (disgusted) What? What can't you do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?</p>

<p>(Chandler and Joey leave the table.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, we might be leaving now.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tell me it's &quot;you and me&quot; we.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm
not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, you can not do this to me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.</p>

<p><b>Lorraine:</b> (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,
Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I hope she throws up on you.</p>

<p>(Joey leaves with Lorraine. Chandler sits back down with Janice.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So...</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Just us.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, what a crappy night!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin'
outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...
other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> So, do we have the best friends or what?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.
Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I will go for that drink.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we
get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Each.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always
wanted to know...</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, Chandler wakes up, and finds someone else's hand on his
chest. He rolls over and is shocked to see Janice there.]</p>

<h3 align="center">Commercial Break</h3>

<p>[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler is trying to get Janice out of his apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Kiss me!</p>

<p>(Janice kisses him. Monica comes out for the newspaper.}</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Chandler, sorry.</p>

<p>(Janice turns around, Monica sees who it is.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Hi, Monica.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, well, this was very special.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, come see who's out here!</p>

<p>(Rachel comes out.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my god. Janice, hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Janice is gonna go away now.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'll be right back.</p>

<p>(Joey enters from the stairs.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Joey, look who it is.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (in disbelief) Whoa.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, good, Joey's home now.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.</p>

<p>(Monica comes out with her cordless phone.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to
Chandler) He just happened to call.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously) </p>

<p>[Scene: A Chinese Restaurant, Ross is there with his date.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole
um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los
Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.</p>

<p>(Ross starts to laugh, and then makes a face like 'Why did I just say that?' Ross'
ex-wife, Carol, and her lesbian lover, Susan, enter the restaurant. Ross stares at them.)</p>

<p><b>Kristin:</b> That's funny. Who are they?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,
personal friend.</p>

<p><b>Kristin:</b> You mean they're lovers.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> If you wanna put a label on it.</p>

<p><b>Kristin:</b> Wow, uh, anything else I should know?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nope, nope, that's it. </p>

<p>(Carol takes off her jacket, her pregnant belly is exposed.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol
and Susan) Helloo!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are holding their boyfriend bonfire.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All I have is, is oregano and a <em>Fresca</em>.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the
ritual in the first place.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Can we just start throwing things in?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer
shorts.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Rachel and Phoebe:</b> Eww!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...</p>

<p>(Rachel throws the alcohol in the fire. A burst of flames shoots up from it.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Chandler is preparing to dump Janice
again.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.</p>

<p>(Janice enters.)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Hello, funny Valentine.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, Just Janice.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and
I'm gonna!</p>

<p>(Janice kisses Joey all over. Chandler smiles.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Chinese Restaurant.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, um, what do you do for a living?</p>

<p><b>Kristin:</b> Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..(Ross is watching
Carol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left
stranded)...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. </p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
(Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. </p>

<p><b>Kristin:</b> (reluctantly) I guess.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's
try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that,
funnily enough, wasn't even her major!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, firemen are there to handle the bonfire that got out of
control.]</p>

<p><b>Fireman No. 1:</b> What do we got there?</p>

<p><b>Fireman No. 2:</b> A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what
looks like a half-charred picture&#151;Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.</p>

<p><b>Fireman No. 3:</b> It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This
isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.</p>

<p><b>Fireman No. 1:</b> You're our third call tonight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Fireman No. 2:</b> Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk.]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I brought you something.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and
Jan Forever.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I had them made special.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell
you this. At least there's no <b>new</b> way for me to tell you this. I just don't things
are gonna work out.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> That's fine.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (surprised) It is?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no, you see, actually it is.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet?
You love me, Chandler Bing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no I don't.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up
together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I did, but...</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a
foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know
it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.</p>

<p>(She kisses him passionately,then leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Call me!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Chinese Restaurant, Ross and Carol are talking. Kristin is not there.]</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You did so. I swear, I swear&#151;(noticing Kristin's absence) How long
has she been in the bathroom?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had
in 9 years. </p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> That could be it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still
pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off
and eats it.)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay
through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it's just...you know the whole &quot;getting on with your life&quot;
thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and
she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin'
to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know,
here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know
what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for
now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know.
You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see,
you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.</p>

<p>(They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, I love you too. But...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No but, no but.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to
take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting
for you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's easy for you to say, you found one already.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.</p>

<p>(A beautiful woman walks by Ross, he stares at her.)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Not her.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's job, Chandler is typing data into his computer, he keeps typing even
while taking a drink of coffee with one hand. One of his co-workers walks by.]</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a <b>very</b>
flattering sleeve length on you.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Tedlock:</b> Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the
end of the day.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do
with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from
the woman.) Nothing.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there but Chandler. Phoebe runs in, excitedly.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this
incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...</p>

<p>(Chandler comes in.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Never mind. But it was going to be really good.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> What is it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al
calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> That's great!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So.... I quit.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I
actually do.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So was it a lot more money?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in
his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.</p>

<p>(Everyone looks at him, confused.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> ... the WENUS?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So what're you going to do?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just
know I'm not going to figure it out working there.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client...
Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know.
You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a
job right now, so....</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's
an all-toast restaurant.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah! </p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Well, what kind of food is he looking for?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who
can, you know, create the entire menu.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (excited) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler walks in, wearing a suit.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can you see my nipples through this shirt?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I love my life, I love my life!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! <em>Brian's Song</em>!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> The meeting with the guy went great?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this,
it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of
like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me
because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you going to make?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (pause) And Monica, what are <b>you</b> going to make?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in
the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the
stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
(sits down)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Who are you going out with?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, is this the bug lady?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the
museum.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So what are you guys going to do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her
back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And he's <b>not</b> speaking metaphorically.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...
(gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures)
huh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one
look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, Marcel is hanging from Celia's hair, and she is screaming,
trying to get him off.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Celia, don't worry!&nbsp; Don't scream!&nbsp; He's not going to hurt you!
Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...</p>

<p><b>Celia:</b> I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright... (lifts Marcel away)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Ross and Chandler. Monica is making
food, and having everyone try it.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (tasting) Mmmm. Good.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is it better than the other salmon mousse?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's creamier.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well, is that <b>better</b>?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm
keeping it down, y'know?</p>

<p>(Chandler kicks the door closed, angrily. His clothes are askew, he looks beat.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> My God! What happened to you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,
personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) &quot;You
are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational
corporation.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be
doing something really <b>cool</b>? You know, I just always pictured myself doing
something...something.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh,
hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll
cheer you up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split
this with you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it
an <em>amouz-bouche.</em> </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...</p>

<p>(Phone rings. Monica answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock.
(Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All
right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ten dollars an hour for what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (hurt) Waitressing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh-oh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But, but?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?
And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I
can waitress in the Olympics.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in
'76. (dead silence) <em>Amouz-bouche</em>? (holds out tray)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross' apartment, <em>Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon </em>(the original, not that
cruddy Urge Overkill version) is playing. Ross and Celia are kissing passionately.]</p>

<p><b>Celia:</b> Talk to me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...</p>

<p><b>Celia:</b> No no no. Talk... dirty.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?</p>

<p><b>Celia:</b> Yes...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah....</p>

<p><b>Celia:</b> Say something..... <b>hot</b>.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (panicked) Er.... um..... </p>

<p><b>Celia:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um... uh.... vulva.</p>

<h3 align="center">Commercial Break</h3>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Ross are there, discussing what happened last
night.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (in disbelief) <b>Vulva</b>?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it
wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind
of guy, you know?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you
want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll
tell you what. Just try something on me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (deadpan) Please be kidding.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like
to be doing right now.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> ....yeah... what else?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this
conversation. (gets up, walks across room)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey, please.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross....
you get me so hot. I want your lips on me <b>now</b>.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (impressed) Wow.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright, now you say something.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I... ahem... I really don't think so.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on! You like this woman, right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You want to see her again, right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her?
Now tell me you want to caress my butt!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at
me when I'm doing this.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my
lips.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> There you go! Keep going. Keep going!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I, er...</p>

<p>(At this point, Chandler walks into the living room from his bedroom. Ross and Joey
both have their backs to him, so they don't notice. Chandler sees the situation and
remains quiet, watching.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I want to take my tongue... and... </p>

<p>(Chandler is completely astounded.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ....and....</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Say it... say it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...</p>

<p>(Chandler leans back against the wall and Ross and Joey hear him. Ross and Joey both
notice at the same time. They slowly stop, and then very slowly turn around to see
Chandler staring at them.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (smiling)....with??</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (rushing to explain) Funny story!</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> You're not going to believe this!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get
together.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called
again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Again?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands
phone to Chandler) And again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?
(Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens
from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look,
this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I
can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you
mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is
not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm
telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on
Monday! (slams the phone down)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's new window office, he is showing Phoebe around.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this
is a cube.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! You have a window!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh look! That guy's peeing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this
out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sitting) OK.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you
come in here for a moment? </p>

<p>(An unamused woman walks into the office.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you Helen, that'll be all.</p>

<p>(She leaves, obviously perturbed.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Last time I do that, I promise.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is on the phone. Rachel walks in and overhears the
conversation.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised!
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who was that?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ten dollars an hour.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Twelve dollars an hour.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it,
desperate) twenty dollars an hour.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Done.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, later. Rachel is waitressing, Monica is cooking. Phoebe
walks in with Steve (<em>Crystal Duck</em> winner Jon Lovitz).]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi Steve!</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Steve) This is Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> (unconcerned) Yeah, OK.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I
can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop)
of, OK, smells.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> It's a lovely apartment.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> I was just being polite, but, alright. </p>

<p>(They leave on the tour and Rachel goes to follow them but Phoebe stops her and drags
her into the kitchen.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What's up?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> (from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let me, let me get you some wine!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica
brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...
(Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he
finishes)... ginger.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm so glad you liked them!</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a
half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets up
and goes into the kitchen)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> You know, I don't know what I'm looking for. </p>

<p>(Rachel tries to get Monica's attention to tell her Steve is stoned. She pretends to
drag on a joint, and Monica thinks she's giving her the 'OK' signal. Then Rachel does it
again, inhaling deeply this time. Monica waves it off as though she doesn't believe it.)</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> (from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, &quot;You
see!&quot;) You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want
to spoil your appetite.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> (looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, we don't. (reaches for box) </p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends down
to pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries
to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> (childishly) No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Give them to me.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Alright, we'll share.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, give me the...</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks
open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard!
I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on
a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) &quot;Help!&nbsp; I'm drowning! &nbsp;
Help!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> <b>What?</b></p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like
this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?</p>

<p>(The oven goes off.)</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> (excited) Hey!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, all are there except Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What a tool!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You don't want to work for a guy like that.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.</p>

<p>(Ross gets up and goes over to the counter and Joey follows him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I was unbelievable.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth
you have <b>ever</b> heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif...
at one point there were villagers.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk,
it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You cuddled.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, which was nice.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, where the hell is he?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's office, he's on the phone, agitated.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the
WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you
something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams
phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....</p>

<p>Chandler</b>: Oh, and I&#146;ve got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: No, Susan&#146;s gonna be there too. We&#146;ve got dads, we&#146;ve got
lesbians, the whole parenting team.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Well, isn&#146;t, isn&#146;t that gonna be weird?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: No, no. (Distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) I mean, it mighta been
at first, but by now I, I think I&#146;m pretty comfortable with the whole situation.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Ross, that&#146;s <b>my</b> jacket.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: I know.</p>

<p>(Rachel grins as Ross removes the girlie jacket, grabs his own, and rushes out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Lamaze class, several couples and one trio sit on the floor, introducing
themselves to the teacher, who&#146;s got as far as a woman sitting next to Ross, Carol,
and Susan.]</p>
<b>

<p>Woman</b>: Hi, we&#146;re the Rostins. Err, I&#146;m J.C., and he&#146;s Michael, and
we&#146;re having a boy, <b>and</b> a girl.</p>
<b>

<p>Teacher</b>: Good for you. Alrighty, next?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Hi, um, I&#146;m err, (has to clear his throat) I&#146;m Ross Geller, and err
ah... (pats Carol&#146;s bulge) ..that&#146;s, that&#146;s my boy in there, and uh,
(points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol&#146;s,
just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherent
until) ..who&#146;s next?</p>
<b>

<p>Teacher</b>: I&#146;m sorry, I didn&#146;t get... Susan is?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Susan is Carol&#146;s, Carol&#146;s, Carol&#146;s, friend...</p>
<b>

<p>Carol</b>: Life partner.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Like buddies.</p>
<b>

<p>Susan</b>: Like lovers.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: You know how close women can get.</p>

<p>(The teacher smiles, but her eyebrows go up. Susan and Carol pat each other
affectionately.)</p>
<b>

<p>Carol</b>: Susan and I live together.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Although I was married to her.</p>
<b>

<p>Susan</b>: Carol, not me.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Err, right.</p>
<b>

<p>Carol</b>: It&#146;s a little complicated.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: A little.</p>
<b>

<p>Susan</b>: But we&#146;re fine.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah!
That&#146;s like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.</p>

<p>[Scene : Chandler's Office, Chandler is working.]</p>

<p>(Helen&#146;s buzzer is heard on the intercom, so Chandler presses his button, too.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.</p>
<b>

<p>Helen</b>: (Over the intercom) Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Oh, okay. Send her in.</p>

<p>(He hurriedly checks his hair in his computer screen, before taking a sporting trophy
from a drawer to place ostentatiously on his desk. An attractive young woman opens the
door.)</p>
<b>

<p>Nina</b>: Hi.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Hi, Nina. Come on in.</p>
<b>

<p>Nina</b>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Uh, Yes. Yes. I&#146;ve just been going over your data here, and little
thing, you&#146;ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.</p>
<b>

<p>Nina</b>: Which is bad, because?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.</p>
<b>

<p>Nina</b>: Your... excuse me?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...</p>
<b>

<p>Nina</b>: Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won&#146;t happen again. I
wouldn&#146;t want to do anything to hurt your... &quot;wenus.&quot;</p>

<p>(Nina beams flirtatiously at Chandler, who catches her drift, but for once he&#146;s
lost for something to say &amp;ndash; so she nods her head to tell him that he&#146;s
thinking correctly...)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Chandler, and the girls are dividing some Chinese
takeout, while the sitcom <em>Family Matters</em> is playing on the TV.]</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: It&#146;s not just that she&#146;s cute, okay. It&#146;s just that...
she&#146;s really really cute.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: It doesn&#146;t matter. You don&#146;t dip your pen in the company ink.</p>

<p>(Marcel scampers about, interfering with the neatness.)</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Ross, your little creature&#146;s got the remote again.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the
remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...</p>

<p>(Marcel points the remote at Monica&#146;s television, pressing a particular
combination of keys. The logo SAP appears on the screen, and suddenly the dialogue is
dubbed into Spanish.)</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Great.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Relax, I&#146;ll fix it.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: (Looking at the television) Cool... &quot;Urkel&quot; in Spanish is
&quot;Urkel.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: (looking at the remote) How did he do this?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the
Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?</p>

<p>(Rachel slowly spins around, finally noticing that the lights have outstayed their
welcome.)</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Ah no, you see, <b>someone</b> was supposed to take them down around New
Year&#146;s... but obviously <b>someone</b> forgot.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Well, <b>someone</b> was supposed to write &quot;Rach, take down the
lights&quot; and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monica&#146;s note
stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?</p>

<p>(Joey enters, looking extremely pleased with himself.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Hey, where you been?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: I went back to Riff&#146;s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was
coffee, she brought me a tuna melt<a HREF="#&nbsp;toasted tuna sandwich">t</a> and four
plates of curly fries.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Score.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: She is so hot!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run
it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Pheebs?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: (Jumping up) Yeah?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Why? Why would you wanna... do that?&nbsp; Why?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: So that if we went out on a date, she&#146;d be there.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Well, I mean, I&#146;m not my sister&#146;s, you know, whatever, and um...
I mean, it&#146;s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we&#146;ve grown apart,
so, um... I don&#146;t know, why not? Okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Cool, thanks.</p>

<p>(He happily gestures at Chandler that there was nothing to worry about, then exits.
Rachel and Monica are concerned for poor Phoebe, who slides back down next to Ross.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: You okay?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah I&#146;m fine.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?</p>

<p>(The sitcom begins with its familiar refrain, yet with a Latin lilt. Rachel and Monica
do a little dance with their chopsticks, and Phoebe has to grin as Ross joins in the
rhythm.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Lamaze class. Susan is there. Each couple has a doll, for they have just
finished learning how to change a diaper. As Ross rushes in, stepping on the Rostins&#146;
pretend baby, squashing its head flat. It bleats, in protest. He performs emergency
surgery, then hands the doll back to J.C.]</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Sorry.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Hi. Sorry I&#146;m late. Where&#146;s, where&#146;s Carol?</p>
<b>

<p>Susan</b>: Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I&#146;ll get the
information.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know
what&#146;s going on.</p>
<b>

<p>Susan</b>: Oh, good. This&#146;ll be fun.</p>
<b>

<p>Teacher</b>: Alrighty. We&#146;re gonna start with some basic third stage breathing
exercises, so Mummies, why don&#146;t you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be
supporting Mummy&#146;s head.</p>

<p>(Ross and Susan each gesture for the other to lie down.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross and Susan</b>: What? What? What?</p>
<b>

<p>Susan</b>: I am supposed to be the mommy?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Okay, I&#146;m gonna play my sperm card <b>one</b> more time.</p>
<b>

<p>Susan</b>: Look, I don&#146;t see why I should have to miss out on the coaching
training just because I&#146;m a woman.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: I see. So what do you propose to do?</p>
<b>

<p>Susan</b>: I will flip you for it.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!</p>
<b>

<p>Susan</b>: (Triumphantly) On your back... Mom.</p>

<p>(Ross gets down like all the other mothers, cradled in Susan&#146;s lap like all the
other fathers.)</p>
<b>

<p>Teacher</b>: Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.</p>

<p>(Forgetting herself, Susan does the &quot;Mommy&quot; action with Ross.)</p>
<b>

<p>Teacher</b>: Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.</p>

<p>(Ross comes out of character to glare into the distance.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's Office. Chandler is playing with a toy as his boss Mr. Douglas
knocks and opens the door.]</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Mr. D, how&#146;s it going, sir?</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Douglas</b>: Ohh, it&#146;s been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: And?</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Douglas</b>: It&#146;s pretty ugly. We haven&#146;t seen an ANUS this bad since the
seventies.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: So what does this mean?</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Douglas</b>: Well, we&#146;re gonna be layin&#146; off people in every department.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my
hair was very very &amp;ndash;</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Douglas</b>: Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's Office, later that day, Nina is in his office.]</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In
pain) Nina.</p>

<p>(She sympathetically reaches out to fondle the inner thigh of his left leg.)</p>
<b>

<p>Nina</b>: Are you okay?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I
called you in here today was, err... please don&#146;t hate me.</p>
<b>

<p>Nina</b>: (Taking her hand away) What?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?</p>

<p>(Nina gasps in surprise and relief.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is at the counter, serving coffee to Phoebe.]</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from <em>Crabtree and Evelyn</em>?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Ooh, okay... good.</p>

<p>(Jamie Buchman and Fran Devanow enter the coffee house. They look about them as Jamie
removes her coat and scarf.)</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: What is this place?</p>
<b>

<p>Fran</b>: Look, you&#146;re cold, I have to pee, and... (indicating the sign)
..there&#146;s a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?</p>

<p>(Jamie notices Phoebe sitting at the counter.)</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: I think we have an answer.</p>
<b>

<p>Fran</b>: What&#146;s she doing here?</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: This could be God&#146;s way of telling us to eat at home.</p>
<b>

<p>Fran</b>: Think she got fired at Riff&#146;s?</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... (shuddering at the memory)
..bringing swordfish. (Indicating the ladies&#146; bathroom) are you gonna go to the, um?</p>
<b>

<p>Fran</b>: I&#146;m gonna wait till after we order. It&#146;s her, right.</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: It looks like her.</p>

<p>(Phoebe walks by, ignoring the two strangers.)</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: Um, excuse me.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah?</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: Hi, it&#146;s us.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: (Smiling blankly) Right, and it&#146;s me.</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: So, so you&#146;re here too?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Much as you are.</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: (Without moving her lips) Your turn.</p>
<b>

<p>Fran</b>: Err... we know what we want.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: (Philosophically) Oh, that&#146;s good.</p>
<b>

<p>Jamie</b>: All we want is two Caffe Lattes.</p>
<b>

<p>Fran</b>: And some biscottie cookies.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Good choice.</p>

<p>(Phoebe turns away so that the two weird women won&#146;t see the face she pulls, and
sits down.)</p>

<p>Chandler</b>: Sure, why not?</p>
<b>

<p>Nina</b>: Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) You&#146;re amazing!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Oh, you don&#146;t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure
we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder&#146;s raise?</p>
<b>

<p>Helen</b>: (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profile
to Personnel?</p>
<b>

<p>Nina</b>: What?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?</p>

<p>(Nina puts her hands on her hips, then gives Chandler a quizzical look.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel&#146;s, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Phoebe are sharing a bowl
of popcorn, while Monica carefully reads the instruction manual for her television set.]</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Well, I ended up telling her everything.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Oh, how&#146;d she take it?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.)
Little tip: if you&#146;re ever in a similar situation, never <b>ever</b> leave your
hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Okay, I think I get how to do this.</p>

<p>(Monica points the remote at her TV, and punches out a key combination from the book,
but the dreaded SAP logo remains and Spanish still comes forth.)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go
away? Because I can&#146;t, I can&#146;t watch.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, they&#146;re gone.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Are you alright?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah. It&#146;s just, you know, it&#146;s this whole stupid <b>Ursula</b>
thing, it&#146;s...</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he&#146;s going out with her. I mean, is it
really so terrible?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I&#146;m not saying she&#146;s like <b>evil</b> or
anything. She just, you know, she&#146;s always breaking my <b>stuff</b>. When I was
eight, and I wouldn&#146;t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the
bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a
boyfriend who was like your best friend?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica and Rachel</b>: (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Well, but that&#146;s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole
him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn&#146;t even <b>talk</b> to me
any more. Because he said he didn&#146;t wanna be around... <b>anything</b> that looked
like either one of us.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Oh... Oh, Pheebs.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: You&#146;re not gonna lose him.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah. Okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: No, come on, he doesn&#146;t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: But he&#146;s falling in <b>love</b> with her.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Oh please, they&#146;ve been going out a week. They haven&#146;t even slept
together yet, I mean, that&#146;s not serious.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Okay... Okay.</p>

<p>(Monica and Ross indicate that they mean right now.)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh, okay, oh.</p>

<p>(Phoebe gets up and walks across the hallway, but the door to Chandler and Joey&#146;s
apartment is shut. She knocks, and anxiously waits for Joey to come, but instead her
identical twin sister emerges wearing one of Joey&#146;s shirts.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ursula</b>: (Surprised) Oh.</p>

<p>(Phoebe reels back in shock, while Ursula defiantly leans against the doorpost as
though she owns the place.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ursula</b>: Yeah, um, may we help you?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is taking down the Christmas lights. Monica
sees her, so she leans out of the small side window.]</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Rachel, what are you doing? It&#146;s freezing out here. Would you come
back inside?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the
railing to reach the top of a pole) ..I&#146;m takin&#146; &#146;em down. Okay? Whoa!
(Screams.)</p>

<p>(Rachel slips, loses her balance, and falls over the edge..)</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!</p>

<p>(In the apartment below, Mr.Heckles is trying to relax and read his newspaper, but
Rachel is helplessly dangling upside-down with her ankle wrapped up in the Christmas
lights.)</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: (To Monica) I&#146;m okay! I&#146;m okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles's
window.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?</p>

<p>[Scene: An Emergency Room, Rachel and Monica enter.&nbsp; Rachel is limping and leaning
on Monica for support.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.</p>

<p>(They reach the desk. The bored nurse thinks she's heard it all before.)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she
fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>: My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?</p>

<p>(Rachel glares at the nurse, who gives Monica a form attached to a clipboard.)</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>: Fill this out and bring it back to me.</p>

<p>(Monica helps Rachel over to a vacant seat.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.</p>

<p>(Monica starts on the form, while Rachel catches her breath and massages her ankle.)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: You.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Really?</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and
kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: (No longer touched) you don't have insurance?</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Why, how much is this gonna cost?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Well there's not much we can do.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as
my &quot;In case of emergency&quot; person?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her
voice anyway) That's insurance fraud.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Well, alright, then, forget it. (Getting up to go) Might as well just go
home. Ow ow ow ow!</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: (Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Thank you. Thank you. I love you.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: (to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny
laugh) these forms (tiny laugh).</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>: Why?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: (Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling
out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine.</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>: You <b>are</b> an idiot. (She hands over a blank form).</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: (Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am <b>that</b> stupid (tiny
laugh).</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, has split up his newspaper so Joey can look at the
funnies, while Ross's inappropriate joke at Lamaze class has come back to haunt him.]</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Joey</b>: That's nice.</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: No, no, <b>with</b> him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm
on this field, and they, they <b>hike</b> me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do
something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right <b>at</b> me.</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us.
And so I uh, hah-hah, I just <b>heave</b> it down field.</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: What are you crazy? That's a baby!</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: He should take the sack?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that <b>I'm</b> the one
who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in
time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am <b>so</b>
not ready to be a father.</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most
responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.</p>

<p>(Feeling a little better, Ross fetches more coffee.)</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real
expensive?</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Well, only if you order stuff.</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Wo-wo-whoa. What about <b>Phoebe's</b> birthday?</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: When's that?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Tonight.</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?</p>

<p>(Joey begins to contemplate his ill fortune.)</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: You take your time.</p>

<p>(Joey looks at his friends, thinks a bit more, then realises.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: There it is! So what're you gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with
Ursula.</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: And your friend Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't
you guys?</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Man, if you tried something like that on <b>my</b> birthday, you'd be
starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.</p>

<p>(Joey gestures to show that he wouldn't dare...)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hospital, Monica and Rachel are waiting for the doctors to arrive. &nbsp;
They enter and are played by Noah Wyle and George Clooney.]</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell</b>: ..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.</p>

<p>(They approach the young ladies. Dr. Mitchell consults Ms.Geller's admissions form.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell</b>: Okay, errrr, Monica?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b> (as Monica): Hi, this is my friend Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b> (as Rachel): Hi.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell</b>: (Smiling) Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen</b>: (Smiling even more and attempting to take over) And I'm his friend,
Dr.Rosen.</p>

<p>(Monica and Rachel smile back prettily.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen</b>: Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: I meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, I meant young,
young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b> (as Rachel): Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b> (as Monica): Right.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone but Joey is waiting for Phoebe to arrive for her
surprise birthday party.&nbsp; Rachel and Monica is telling Chandler about Rachel's
incident.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Uh, you left out the stupid part.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow
night, and I said &quot;yes.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's
like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the
air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Alright, what have we learned so far?</p>

<p>(There is a knock at the door. Someone turns the music off, then the whole party runs
and hides, except for Monica and Rachel who answer their door. Ross stands in the doorway,
holding a box, but everyone is too keyed up to notice that it's him.)</p>

<p><b>The Whole Party</b>: (Jumping up) <b>SURPRISE!!!</b></p>

<p>(Ross is so startled that he throws his arms up to defend himself. The box takes off,
then lands with a squishy thud, its contents oozing out onto the floor. Ross is not
pleased.)</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Was that the cake?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Come on, she'll be here any minute.</p>

<p>(The whole party gathers round as Ross puts the box on the coffee table.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: I hope it's okay.</p>

<p>(As Ross opens the lid, everybody looks at the mess inside.)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh...</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: (Reading) &quot;Happy Birthday Peehe.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.</p>

<p>(Phoebe quietly wanders in, to join the tableau.)</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: (Still annoyed) Yeah, we'll just use our special <b>cake</b> tools.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey, what's going on?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh, we just...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe's Friends</b>: (Finally noticing the guest of honour) <b>Surprise!</b></p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: (Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all
scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging
people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey?</p>

<p>(The party falls flat. Chandler tries to think of a witticism, but even he can't
help...)</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Did you see Betty?</p>

<p>(Betty waggles her fingers to say &quot;Hi&quot;, but Phoebe feels her birthday has
been ruined by her twin.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A Restaurant, Ross is having lunch with his father who is examining his next
forkful.]</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of
this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a
tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say &quot;get out of my office!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had
come to me with the idea andndash;</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh,
ever get this sort of... panicky, &quot;Oh my god I'm gonna be a father&quot; kind of a
thing?</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the
business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff
together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know,
um... when did you start to feel like a father?</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were
born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and
gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my
finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.</p>

<p>(Ross is so moved by his father's charming story, that he stops eating.)</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: No, we can go to Williamsburg.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> Eat your fish.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is just getting off of the intercom and turns off
the TV which is still in the SAP mode.]</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Rachel, the cute doctors are here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: (entering from her room) Okay, coming!</p>

<p>(Monica opens the door for Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Geoffrey.)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Hi, come on in.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Hi, Geoffrey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Hi.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen:</b> Ah here, we brought wine.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell:</b> Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine,
so how could we resist?</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, that's great. Look at that.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen:</b> So, Monica, how's the ankle?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: It's uh...</p>

<p>(Rachel discreetly coughs to warn her.)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b> (as Rachel): ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, <b>is</b>
your ankle.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b> (as Monica): You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um...
Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay...
(They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT!</p>

<p>(Rachel joins Monica who is in the kitchen area, opening the wine bottle. Rachel checks
that the doctors aren't listening, then lowers her voice anyway.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really
are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: It will <b>not</b> be fine. We'll get in trouble.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, Monica! Would you <b>stop</b> being such a <b>wuss</b>?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?</p>

<p>(Back at the couch, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Rosen have concerns of their own.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell:</b> So?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen:</b> So... they sss-still seem normal.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell:</b> That's because they are.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen:</b> (Nervously) okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out...
Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell:</b> Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in
the corners, they're fine. (Baring his teeth to clean them with his finger) Go like this.
(Dr. Rosen obeys.)</p>

<p>(Meanwhile, back at the sink.)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a
big baby.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: (Resenting the truth) I am <b>not a baby!</b> You know what? I swear to
god, just because you get so uptight every time we...</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Sure, every time, you're such a princess...</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: You know what?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: You know what?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: What!?</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: You know what?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: (getting angry) <b>What!!?</b></p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.</p>

<p>(Rachel brightly limps back across the apartment with glasses of wine for the cute
doctors, leaving an open-mouthed Monica in her wake.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Hello! Here we go!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen:</b> This is a great place. How long have you lived here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in
a few months ago.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get
married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.</p>

<p>(Rachel tries to hide her alarm, but she squirms in her chair.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey,
that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen:</b> So, Monica, what do you do?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen:</b> Good for you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to <b>boss</b> people
around, which I just <b>love</b> to do.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rosen:</b> This hummus is great.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell:</b> God bless the chickpea.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!</p>

<p>(The doctors don't know what to make of all this.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I
was a cow?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) <b>We both
do that!</b></p>

<p>(Rachel lets her anger show too. Hideously embarrassed, the doctors drain their glasses
in the vicious pause which follows. The telephone rings, but the girls just glower at each
other, silently daring the other to move first. Finally both guys jump up, and Michael
wins.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell:</b> (on the phone) Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh,
just one second... (handing it to Monica) ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away
from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um...
there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...</p>

<p>(Monica glares triumphantly across the room, scaring Rachel who also stands up.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Would you excuse me for a second?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel
can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.</p>

<p>(Completely undone by Monica's verbal destruction, Rachel almost loses her balance as
she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way
to turn. Finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned Dr. Mitchell looks
philosophically at Dr. Rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan
altar.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Ross, Phoebe, Chandler and Monica sit
round the coffee table, playing Scrabble. Rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading
on the phone, her free hand shaking with agitation.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy
Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping
the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing &quot;You are...&quot;)
...dead!</p>

<p>(Monica smiles a sweet apology of regret, until she's distracted by Marcel as he
clambers all over her nice furniture.)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Ross, he's got the remote again.</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Good. Maybe <b>he</b> can switch it back.</p>

<p>(Marcel changes channel to Bugs Bunny, who is speaking in Spanish.)</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Maybe not.</p>

<p>(Meanwhile, Rachel has taken another call, from a nurse she'd hoped never to hear from
again.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes
the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just
check and see if see if she's here.</p>

<p>(All animosity forgotten, Rachel holds the receiver out as she limps quickly over to
her friend, who stands up in concern.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a
problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...</p>

<p><b>Rachel and Monica</b>: Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out
what they want!</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at
Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank
you. (Hangs up)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: What?</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This
was just not worth it.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay, let me just change.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Yes.</p>

<p>(Rachel goes to her room.)</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: (entering quietly) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross and Chandler</b>: Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Hi.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Trouble?</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Your sister stood me up the other night.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, no. Don't you <b>hate</b> it when people aren't <b>there</b> for
you?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Well did you try calling <b>her</b>?</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she
was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.</p>

<p>(Phoebe wants to be angry with Joey, but as she watches him shaking his head in pain
and disbelief, she knows that it isn't his fault.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Riff's, Phoebe is entering. Ursula returns with two plates of chicken, but she
only has time to set one on the table, when...]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey.</p>

<p>(Ursula turns in surprise.)</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Oh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Um you, you got a minute?</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Um, yeah, I'm just... (waving dismissively at the concept) ..working.</p>

<p>(Ursula points out a vacant table, so the twins walk over, side by side, to sit down.
Departing customers walk right past the pair. Sitting at the back, a hungry gentleman
looks most annoyed as Ursula sets his meal down in front of her. The girls sit.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: So.</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>(Ursula is genuinely pleased that her sister has visited her, after so many years.
Phoebe hesitates over how best to begin.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.</p>

<p>(Ursula picks up a fork and begins eating the meat, while Phoebe removes a present from
her bag.)</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Oh, wow! You remembered! (Opening it) Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!</p>

<p>(She laughs at the childhood memory. Phoebe smiles at being able to make her point.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Right, like the kind you...</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.</p>

<p>(Ursula gets up to fetch a box from her bag by the counter.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: How'd you know I was coming?</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Um, yeah, um, twin thing.</p>

<p>(Ursula puts the box directly into Phoebe's hand. Phoebe brightens.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: I can't believe you did this.</p>

<p>(Phoebe opens the box, to find something familiar inside.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: I can't believe you... (holding up Joey's cardigan) ..did this.</p>

<p>(Phoebe's smile hardens as she packs the cardigan away.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.</p>

<p>(Ursula resumes eating her lunch..)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Does he <b>know</b>?</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Who?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: He is? Why?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: You got me.</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Right.</p>

<p>(A waiter comes over for the stolen chicken. Ursula turns to him.)</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?</p>

<p>(The man gives up, shaking his head.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: So, um, are you gonna call him?</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: What? (Indicating the departing waiter) Do you think he likes me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: No, <b>Joey</b>.</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. (Offering to share her
food) Do you want some chicken?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: No. No food with a face.</p>

<p><b>Ursula</b>: You have not changed!</p>

<p>(Ursula's eyes dance as she laughs and smiles, simply glad to be back with her sister.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, you too.</p>

<p>(Trying not to wrinkle her nose, Phoebe smiles back realising it's down to her to make
up for her negligent sister. Meanwhile, Ursula still hasn't received her side salad, but
when she attempts to attract the waiter's attention, he ignores her.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Emergency Room. The officious admissions nurse is again on duty. Rachel and
Monica enter, looking worried. As they approach the desk, Rachel adopts a winning smile,
while Monica struggles to smile at all.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) Hi, remember us?</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>: (Grimacing) Mmm hmmm.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a
signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a <b>whole new one</b>
(little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause
um...</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>: You're <b>that</b> stupid.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) I am. I'm <b>that</b> stupid. (Little laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>: Well, you know your insurance will cover that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not
that bright either.</p>

<p>(The girls escape with a new form.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is neglecting the game of <em>Scrabble</em>, for
he's busily drawing on his own childhood in an attempt to help Ross. Marcel chitters
about.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Okay, worst case scenario. Say you <b>never</b> feel like a father.</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his
relationships are affected by this.</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Do you have a point?</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: You know, you think I would.</p>

<p>(Instead of scampering, Marcel stretches his neck as much as possible, and makes an
unvoiced noise from his throat.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: What's up with the simian?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: It's just a fur ball.</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: No, no, you got <b>zero</b> points for 'IDNEY'.</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?</p>

<p>(The unvoiced hissing continues. In alarm, Ross and Chandler look at the monkey, who is
now in some distress.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Emergency Room, Monica sits with Rachel, who is filling out an honest form
at last. Ross and Chandler hurtle in. Little Marcel, wrapped in a fluffy towel, is cradled
in Ross's arms. They dash up to the admissions desk. Ross is frantic.]</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!</p>

<p>(Hearing her brother's voice, Monica gets up to stand behind Chandler, followed by
Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>: (angrily) You go get that animal outta <b>here</b>.</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's
choking I don't know what else to do.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: What's goin' on?</p>

<p>(Ross and Chandler turn at the voice...)</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Marcel swallowed a <em>Scrabble</em> tile.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh.</p>

<p>(..then turn back to the desk when the surprise hits them, and Ross and Chandler whip
around once more. Monica and Rachel recoil slightly.)</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>: Excuse me... This hospital is for <b>people!</b></p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Lady, he <b>is</b> people. He has a name, okay? He watches <em>Jeopardy!</em>
He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!</p>

<p>(Ross's vigorous protest is attracting attention.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell</b>: I'll take a look at him.</p>

<p>(Rachel, Monica, Ross and Chandler whip around for a second time, in formation.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel and Monica</b>: Oh, thank you.</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Michael.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Mitchell</b>: Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) Monica.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (as Rachel) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as Monica) Hi.</p>

<p>(Monica smiles to cover her embarrassment, but Rachel sadly looks away...)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is playing &quot;She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not&quot; with
the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. Phoebe enters, but not as
herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin
sister. She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. Nervously, she smooths out the
identifying garment, approaching Joey who sits next to the main sofa.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as Ursula) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Urse...</p>

<p>(Phoebe nods as he stands up in delight.)</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: ..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as Ursula) Listen, um...</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: No, no, no, don't say &quot;listen.&quot; I know that &quot;listen.&quot;
I've said that &quot;listen.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as Ursula) I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the
bridge?</p>

<p>(Phoebe is almost thrown by this.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as Ursula): Yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) You know you, you
should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' <b>crazy</b> that
night, I was so drunk!</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: You don't drink.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: (Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's
either her or me.</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Then, uh, then I'm sorry.</p>

<p>(He sinks to the sofa, saddened by Ursula's ultimatum, while Phoebe follows, touched by
Joey's good heart.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee)
You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: I know...</p>

<p>(He looks up at her face and Phoebe, slipping out of character, smiles back at him.
Joey's voice becomes soft and warm.)</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but
you have never looked so beautiful.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Really?</p>

<p>(Phoebe smiles, when Joey takes her face in his hands and kisses her. Joey gets up to
leave but stops suddenly. Phoebe silently shouts &quot;Oh, whoa!!&quot; to herself, and
leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her tingling lips. A thoughtful Joey is also
feeling <b>his</b> lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he
thinks again, cocking his head from side to side to regard her profile from various
angles, then...)</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: (Automatically) Yeah. Oooh... (she's sprung.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hospital, Marcel lies on the operating table while recovering from the
anaesthetic, tucked up under a sheet like an infant in a huge bed. Ross sits beside him,
as a smiling Chandler, Monica and Rachel look on.]</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: He looks so tiny.</p>

<p>(The door bursts open, and Joey and Phoebe rush in.)</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: We just got the message.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Is he alright?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'</p>

<p>(Ross does not approve of Chandler's daft theory.)</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: No, why?</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is
very dad.</p>

<p>(Ross does approve of this, but he's still not sure. The tiny figure stirs.)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh, look, he's waking up!</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?</p>

<p>(All of a sudden, Marcel grabs Ross's finger with his whole fist, and he squeezes it,
so tight, that Ross finally knows what it is to be a father. He looks up at his friends,
who smile encouragingly, Rachel tenderly resting her chin upon Monica's shoulder. Ross
realises that Chandler was right and he's gonna make a great dad!)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is there.&nbsp; Rachel is looking out
of the window and Ross is handing out some Chinese takeout.&nbsp; There's a small SAP in
the corner of the screen.]</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Aqui est. (Here it is!)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: A quin pidio el pollo General Tso? (Who ordered General Sal's
chicken?)</p>

<p><b>Chandler</b>: Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!)</p>

<p>(Rachel points out of the window.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel</b>: Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop! (Look, look,
Ugly Naked Guy is doing the hula!)</p>

<p>(The others rush to the window for a look.)</p>

<p><b>All</b>:Ewww! (Ewww!)</p>

<p>(Joey enters, happy again.)</p>

<p><b>All</b>: Hola, Joey! (Hi, Joey!)</p>

<p><b>Joey</b>: Hola, amigos! (Hey, everybody!)</p>

<p>(Marcel grabs the remote.)</p>

<p><b>Monica</b>: Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. (Look, Ross, Marcel's got
the remote.)</p>

<p><b>Ross</b>: Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (The thing is, he doesn`t
like the program!)</p>

<p>(Everybody laughs.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you really want a job with <i>Popular Mechanics</i>?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work
for.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a

Did you bring the mail?</p>

<p>(Camera cuts to Chandler and Ross at table.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out
with her again?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really
happened' thing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it's not just that. It's just&#151;I want someone who... who <b>does</b>
something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins
to stare lovingly at Rachel)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And then he did.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, women are welcome to play.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me, do any of <b>you</b> know how to play?</p>

<p><b>Girls:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But you could teach us.</p>

<p><b>Guys:</b> No.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the guys are teaching the girls how to play poker.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, good for you!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Congratulations!</p>

<p>(Microwave timer goes off. Monica gets up.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK Phoebs, how many do you want?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.</p>

<p>(Monica comes back to the table with plates of food.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe and Rachel:</b> OOooooo!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You
can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or
pretz...(look of realization)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High

<p><b>Joey:</b> Heh... I was <b>bluffing</b>.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before
work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)</p>

<p><b>Guys:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Settle what?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us
the land, so...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget
about the money, alright?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hell no, we'll pay!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And you know what? We want a rematch.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross): So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of
your friends.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (pause)...Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, and I get my ya-yas from <i>Ikea</i>. You have to put them
together yourself, but they cost a little less.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to
win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to
be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (pause)...Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm <b>not</b> a nice guy.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross' apartment. Chandler and Joey are there. Ross enters with a pizza.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright boys, let's eat.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You still on that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking):
&quot;When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You are way off, pal.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time&#151;not any
more. I just&#151;I...</p>

<p>(Marcel makes a screeching noise in background.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?</p>

<p>(Marcel puts a CD in the player.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK&#151;if you press that
button, you are in very, very big trouble.</p>

<p>(<i>The Lion Sleeps Tonight</i> starts to play. Marcel starts to dance.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ha. Ha, ha.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Please! I am not as bad as Ross.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I beg to differ. The <i>Pictionary</i> incident?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That was <b>not</b> an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate
slipped out of my hand.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised): Oh! I got an interview! I got an
interview!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You're kidding! Where? Where?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (in disbelief): Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, what's the job?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!</p>

<p>(Knock on door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she
was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Aunt Iris:</b> Is Tony Randall dead?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Aunt Iris:</b> Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Aunt Iris:</b> No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. (walks into kitchen) Let me
tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. (to Phoebe): Nice
earrings.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank y... (thinks about it)</p>

<p><b>Aunt Iris:</b> Girls, sit down.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...</p>

<p><b>Aunt Iris:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's
do it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, everyone but Rachel is seated around his table. <i>The Lion
Sleep Tonight</i> plays in the background.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright.</p>

<p>(Ross shuts off the CD player. Marcel runs into the bedroom and slams the door.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm gonna pay for <b>that</b> tonight.</p>

<p>(Knock on door. Ross opens it. Rachel enters.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all
recommending <i>Trident</i>?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked
for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and&#151;oh, I went to
camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> That's great! That's wonderful!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to
play, we completely understand.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't
know... <i>Pictionary</i>?</p>

<p>(The guys all duck under the table.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker
another try. Shall we, ladies?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe and Rachel:</b> Yes, we should. I think we should.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen
big ones.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play
that at our regular game.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should
know that this money is cursed.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way
I can break 'em up with a movie.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I
have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will
win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last
dime you have, and you will hate yourselves <b>forever</b>.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there ready for another poker game.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of actually playing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look,
the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker.</p>

<p>(Ross gets up from the table.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Excuse me, where are you going?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh... to the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store
closes at nine, so you can eat then.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's fine. I'll just have a <i>Tic-Tac</i> to hold me over.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.</p>

<p>(Ross comes back from bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright. (to Rachel): Your money's mine, Green.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)</p>

<p>(Time lapse.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'
Coincidence?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm in.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Me too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Me too. Alright, whattaya got.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down
cards)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down
cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna
make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I
think&#151;oh&#151;that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing): <i>Well, I have got your
money, and you'll never see it</i>...</p>

<p>(Ross stands up.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And your fly's still open...</p>

<p>(Ross looks down.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ha, I made you look.... </p>

<p>(Time lapse.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I couldn't be inner. Monica?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica, in or out?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (slams down cards) I hate this game! </p>

<p>(Joey slides a plate away from Monica towards Chandler, who hides it under the table.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK Joey, your bet.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy
with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I am very in.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Me too. Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do
you say... want to waste another buck?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm not telling. (collects chips)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No..!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Show them to me!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Get your hands out of there! No!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Let me see! Show them!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I've had dates like this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your
whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.</p>

<p>(Ross is visibly upset.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> First of all, I'm not losing...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the <b>job</b>.</p>

<p>(Rachel walks into kitchen to talk on the phone.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand.
Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if
anything else opens up, plea&#151;Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)</p>

<p>(Rachel goes back and sits down. The rest don't know what to say.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sorry, Rach.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh...
jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, we do. (pause)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, check.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Check.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Call.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm in.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws it
in)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does
anybody have a problem with that?</p>

<p>(Everyone says no and folds, except for Ross, who thinks about it.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross): Loser?</p>

<p>(Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe back their chairs away from the table.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that
'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?</p>

<p>(Ross thinks it over, finally sits down and picks up his cards.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm in. (throws in chips)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How many you want?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> One. (Rachel gives him the card.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I bet two dollars. (throws it in)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)</p>

<p>(The other four look amazed at the large pot.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.</p>

<p>(Monica gets up, looks in Rachel's purse.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, there's nothing in it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, then get me your purse.</p>

<p>(Monica gets Rachel her purse.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, here you go. Good luck.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Monica): Thank you. (to Ross): I saw your twenty-five, and I raise
you... seven.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)</p>

<p>(Ross looks in his wallet, pulls out two dollars.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Joey): Joey, I'm a little shy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?</p>

<p>(Ross looks at Joey, dumbfounded at his stupidity.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fifteen.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good luck.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?</p>

<p>(Long pause as they both look at each other.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (lays down cards) Full house.</p>

<p>(Ross stares at her. Thinks about it. Puts cards on table, face down.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You got me.</p>

<p>(Monica and Phoebe get up and start celebrating in the kitchen, pouring wine and
singing. Rachel, shocked, goes to join them.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross): I thought we had them!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you
know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)</p>

<p>(Chandler and Joey look at her, and then look back at him. They dive for Ross's hand to
see what he had, and he tries to stop them from looking.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I
should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with
men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right
guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With
Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's
like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone
who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and
bombs and, like, buses going really fast...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a
little nudity.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> There was nudity!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I meant <strong>female </strong>nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou
Grant frolicking.</p>

<p><strong>Monica and </strong><b>Phoebe:</b> Hugh! Hugh Grant!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath.

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they
would've happened already?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone
exactly like me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She really said that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for
someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> 'Tonight' tonight?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she
spent all day taking care of my monkey...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over
there and, uh, try to woo her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the
1890's, when that phrase was last used.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is taking care of Marcel and they are watching a
soap opera.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used
to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying.
Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with
Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the
shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the
newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry.
Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment
holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out
in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died?
Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the
open door)</p>

<p>[Time lapse. Now everyone but Ross and Phoebe is back at Monica and Rachel's.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How could you lose him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know. The left one.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Which <strong>ones</strong>?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, how?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He- he pooped in my shoe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Which one?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, which <strong>one</strong>? The right or left? 'Cause the left one
is lucky...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you
go?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of
the touristy things. I'll go to <em>Cats</em>, you go to the <em>Russian Tea Room</em>.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna
kill me!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second
floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray <em>Lysol </em>in
my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.</p>

<p>(They all leave)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Anybody wanna trade? Oh...</p>

<p>[Cut to a hallway in the building, Monica and Phoebe are knocking on a door. Mr.
Heckles emerges.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> Whaddyou want?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> I wasn't ready for it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> Saw Regis Philbin once...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> You owe me a waffle.</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica and Rachel's.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white
face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay.
Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. You, uh, you want some?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it
here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder
capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we
were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine)
Well-</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine) </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, what? What-what?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.</p>

<p>[Cut to outside the window, with Ross reacting with disbelief. The shot pans back until
we see Marcel sitting on the window ledge.]</font></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Commercial Break</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do
was keep him in the apartment.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I know, I'm sorry-</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've,
uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a
pencil.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody
looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?</p>

<p><strong>Intercom:</strong> Animal Control.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> See? I've even called Animal Control!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You called Animal Control?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel is an <strong>illegal </strong>exotic animal. I'm not allowed to
have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the
apartment!</p>

<p>(A knock on the door. Rachel swiftly opens it)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, thanks for coming.</p>

<p><strong>Luisa: </strong>(Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his
arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Turned out it was a hat.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Cat!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!</p>

<p>(Luisa nods, but then Monica and Phoebe run in)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My uncle Marcel.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh,
punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to
yourself first?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, but there isn't always time!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a
seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The Luisa from home room!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes!!</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> You have no idea who I am, do you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, none at all.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> None.</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean,
would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To
Rachel) But you? What a <strong>bitch</strong>!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that
monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.</p>

<p>[Cut to another part of the building. We see Marcel jump in through a window and run
down some stairs, then Chandler and Joey come down from the upper floor without noticing.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p>(They come to a door and silently agree to try it. A very sweaty woman emerges)</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 1:</b> Hi, can I help you?</p>

<p>(Chandler and Joey are dumbstruck for a moment)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for
something...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> A monkey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes have you seen any?</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 1:</b> No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing
radiators?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 1:</b> Of course.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. Then, no.</p>

<p>(Another sweaty woman comes to the door and speaks to her friend)</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 2:</b> Did I put too much rum in here?</p>

<p>(Joey and Chandler shoot each other glances)</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 1:</b> Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She
starts to shut the door)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about
radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and
cooling... mileu.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're
very hot.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry,
but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers
to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us
out.</p>

<p>(The women quickly shut the door)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Marcel?!</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica and Phoebe searching the basement.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><strong>Both:</strong> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh-my-God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Whaaat!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Something just brushed up against my right leg!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.</p>

<p>(Marcel makes a monkeyish noise. He is sitting in the corner)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, Phoebe!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!</p>

<p>(Luisa appears on the stairs)</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Step aside, ladies! (She loads a gun)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What're you gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Just a small tranquiliser.</p>

<p>(In slow motion we see Phoebe look at Marcel, then at Luisa. She jumps toward Marcel
just as Luisa fires the gun.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after
him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in
the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh gosh.</p>

<p>[Cut to Marcel walking along a hallway. He notices a banana on the floor and picks it
up. The hand of an unseen person grabs him and carries him away. Then cut to Ross and
Rachel on the street outside.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's
gone, he's-he's just gone.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you don't know that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a
sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot!
Thank you very much.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do?
You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the
sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you <strong>happy</strong> now?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel
any more!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort
of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally
oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, forget it, okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What?</p>

<p>(A man carrying a box of bananas walks past them. They stare for a minute and then
hobble after him)</p>

<p><strong>Both:</strong> Hey! Hey, Bananaman!</p>

<p>(Scene 4: Everyone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles' door. Ross is carrying the box of
bananas. He bangs on the door)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the
other side has no idea.</p>

<p>(Mr. Heckles opens the door)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi, did you order some bananas?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> What about it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Gimme back my monkey.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> I don't have a monkey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then what's with all the bananas?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> Potassium.</p>

<p>(There is a monkey-like noise from within and Ross pushes past Mr. Heckles and enters
his apartment)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?</p>

<p>(Marcel jumps into view wearing a pink dress. Everybody gasps)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel! What've you done to him?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> C'mere, Patti. (Marcel turns round)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> C'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr. Heckles)</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> (Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to
the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, gimme my monkey back.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> That's <strong>my </strong>monkey.</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that
back whenever.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright, I want my monkey.</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, c'mon, Luisa!</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Sorry, prom queen.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been
fat.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming
queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I
will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but
please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!
Take it!</p>

<p><b>Luisa:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that
you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Rachel and Ross are there. Ross is trying to get the dress
off Marcel.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel
resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little
outfit.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great.
...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh,
something grape?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That'd be good.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the
main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be
vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh,
not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and,
um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...</p>

<p>(Barry bursts in)</p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Barry?!</p>

<p><strong>Barry:</strong> I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still
in love with you.</p>

<p><strong>Ross and </strong><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We have got to start locking that door!</p>

high school yearbook]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This is me in <em>The Sound of Music</em>. See the von Trapp kids?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's because I'm in front of them.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Eh. I thought that was an alp.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, high school was not my favourite time.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties
and dating and sex.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I
had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?</p>

rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.</p>

of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be
ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...</p>

hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, uh, why didn't you say anything?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up
using the phrase &quot;Yes indeedy-o.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, what's going on?</p>

at the <em>Russian Tea Room</em>, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all
the butter squirts out...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not a good day for birds...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then we took a walk down to <em>Bendall's</em>, and I told him not to,
but he got me a little bottle of <em>Chanel</em>...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling,
stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so
nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!</p>

at the altar?</p>

happens to be your ex-best friend?</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our
honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.</p>

<p>(Pause as Rachel realises...)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I had a bra.</p>

<p>(Barry finds it draped on a cupboard and gives it to Rachel, they kiss as Bobby
enters.)</p>

<p><b>Bobby:</b> Hey, Dr. Farber.</p>

<p>(Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel's mouth.)</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're
starting to see some real progress here.</p>

<p>(Bobby looks on, deadpan.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Bobby:</b> I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.</p>

<p>(Rachel glares at him.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters clutching his phone.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can I use your phone?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be
used as a phone.</p>

<p>(Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe she never got your message.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of
beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...desperate, needy, pathetic?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.</p>

<p>(He calls and quickly hangs up.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How many beeps?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She answered.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is
choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.</p>

<p>(Rachel enters.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How'd he take it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in
your hair?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, do I?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh huh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You had <strong>sex</strong> in his <strong>chair</strong>?!... I said
that a little too loudly, didn't I?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You-you had what?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sex in his chair.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, uh... what were you thinking?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history
there. 'S'like you and Carol.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Please. If she said to you, &quot;Ross, I want you on this couch, right
here, right now,&quot; what would you say? </p>

<p>(Ross flounders.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If it helps, I could slide over.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and
oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Where are you going?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I
have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping
up with it. Okay?</p>

<p>(Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello? Hello?</p>

<p>(Rachel picks up their phone and the ringing stops.&nbsp; As she talks on the phone, an
elaborate visual gag is spun out which is too difficult to describe in words.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes,
yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh.
(Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can
come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All
right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens)
Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So how's Mindy?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta
call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured
that's where you'd be!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning.&nbsp; Chandler is sitting and staring at
his phone.&nbsp; Monica enters and creeps up next to Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Brrrrrrr!</p>

<p>(Chandler clutches at his phone before realising.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hell is filled with people like you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!</p>

<p>(Rachel enters from her room.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (ducking) Get down!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Get down?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...And boogie!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me?
I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp
together... she taught me how to kiss..</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (intrigued) Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> ..Naughty!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right, I'll see you guys later...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to
kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits
and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...</p>

<p>(Joey exits.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why don't you just take it with you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why don't you just call her?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine.
Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I
accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.
(Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna
call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me
back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Don't you have to pee?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> 'S'why I'm dancing...</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is serving coffee as Mindy enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mindy.</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Hey, you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, you.... So, what's up?</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Um.. we should really be sitting for this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure we should... So.</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend
in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause
she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty
face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Will you be my maid of honour?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Of course!</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Oh that's so great!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Was that all you wanted to ask me?</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> That's all!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> That's not all.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh sure it is!</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, what- what would make you think that?</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really
weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like <em>Chanel</em>.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I
was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? What's what you were afraid of?</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a
little thing on the side.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said &quot;Don't do
it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,&quot; and now I feel so stupid.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Oh no.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I am so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> No me, I am so sorry...</p>

<p>(They hug and Joey enters.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (watches them for a while) Oh my.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Ross are doing a crossword, Monica is cooking,
and Chandler is still staring at his phone.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Four letters: &quot;Circle or hoop&quot;.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ring dammit, ring!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just
pointing out the irony.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got
the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nngghhh!!!!!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney
Marks, please.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> &quot;Heating device.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Radiator.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Five letters.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rdtor.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang)
Sidney's a woman.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So she's a woman! So what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking
to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate
it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna
walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel
like&#151;(Listens)&#151;Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The
point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to
Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The green dress? Really?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!</p>

<p>[Scene: Barry's Office, Barry is preparing his tools alone as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey. Got a second?</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in...</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Hello, sweetheart.</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, we are here to break up with you.</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> Both of you?</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should
happen to you.</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I
couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Even when we were having sex in that chair?</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> (to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a
lineup!</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> (to Rachel) You did it twice?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Okay...</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> (to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll
start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.</p>

<p><b>Bernice:</b> (over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency
here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look,
please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.</p>

<p>(Barry exits)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating
when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump
right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels <strong>great</strong>.</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in
a smock!</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I
still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God. </p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still
be my maid of honor...?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have
wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aww... (They hug)</p>

<p>(Joey enters and looks on approvingly.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Big day.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's
got the monocle, he's got the top hat...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know he's gay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?</p>

<p><strong>Danielle:</strong> (entering) Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hi. Hi.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you doing here?</p>

<p><strong>Danielle:</strong> Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your
number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer.
So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...I'm, I'm okay.</p>

<p><strong>Danielle:</strong> Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...</p>

<p><strong>Danielle:</strong> You got it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...I dunno.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You <strong>don't know</strong>?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about
her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?</p>

<p align="left">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is looking at papers.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I have no idea. But look how much they spent!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only
have to pay for the stuff that you bought.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know. It's just such reckless spending.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is
shaking behind the sofa)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-
(Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? It's, it's just a phase.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that's what we said about Joey...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel
emerges from her room.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This woman's living my life.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this,
look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that
I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You're not an artist.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this
stuff. Only I don't.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New
School?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Yawning) Nooo...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my
mother.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How about Joey... Pepponi?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more
neutral.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey... Switzerland?</p>

<p>(The waitress brings their coffee.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like
I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it does not ring a bell with me...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Might wanna try Joseph.</p>

<p>(Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the
Fiddler on the Roof.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm
taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap
class.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit
card?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica,
y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a
weird obsession thing.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, <strong>for the love of God,
Monica, don't do it</strong>!! ...Thank you.</p>

<p>[Scene: A Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What d'you think?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Lotsa things.</p>

<p>(They go in and sit down.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Which one do you think she is?</p>

<p>(The teacher comes up to them.)</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> May I help you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> You don't observe a dance class. You <strong>dance</strong></font><font
size="5"> </font><font size="3">a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What does she mean?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think she means (Imitates) 'You <strong>dance</strong></font><font
size="5"> </font><font size="3">a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. (They put on some spare
shoes)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt
containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> She could be you.</p>

<p>(Music starts)</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...</p>

<p>(Everyone starts to dance in unison. Monica flounders)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I'm not getting this!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably
uncoordinated?</p>

<p>(Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? You just click when they click.</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.</p>

<p>(The girls are unsure how to pair off. Phoebe settles it)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Great. It's gym class all over again.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe and </strong><b>Rachel:</b> Aww.</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.</p>

<p>(She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her
hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I
am. Who's the new tense girl?</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> She's your partner.</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Hi. I'm Monica.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.</p>

<p><strong>Woman:</strong> (Fake Monica) Monana?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. It's Dutch.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her
something in Dutch)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Mortified) Hi.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler and </strong><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Where've you been?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> At the vet.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached
sexual maturity.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So what does this mean?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm gonna have to give him up.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, scene continued from earlier.&nbsp; They guys are sitting there
like the Three Monkeys.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult
already?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you
know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Isn't there any way you can keep him?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to
some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How do you get a monkey into a zoo?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a <em>Volkswagen</em>.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be
one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be
a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a
total party zoo.</p>

<p>(Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey. We found her, we found the girl.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Did you call the cops?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nope. We took her to lunch.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a
stealer.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you
forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing
spirit.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...Take off their hats!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Popes in a <em>Volkswagen</em>! ...I love that joke.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No way. No way did you do this.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Monana was very brave.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.
Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and
have breasts...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I
get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> 'Scuse me?</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing
Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like
you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that
changed my life. Did you ever see <em>Dead Poets' Society</em>?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> I thought that movie was so incredibly... <strong>boring</strong>.
I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?
What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I
walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never
getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, tiem lapse.&nbsp; Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the
others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who
this is harder on, me or him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, somebody will.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) You know there already <strong>is</strong> a Joseph Stalin?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're kidding.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.
You'd think you would've known that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, you'd think I would've.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> ...Flame Boy.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Where exactly is your zoo?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an
interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Does he, uh, fight with other animals?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no, he's, he's very docile.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Even if he were... cornered?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I, I don't know. Why?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Uh, how is he at handling small objects?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...</p>

<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> How about a hammer, or a small blade?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why- why- why would he need a blade?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns,
you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.</p>

<p>(Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler and </strong><b>Joey:</b> He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San
Diego.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ...He's in.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and
good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you
twenty percent of the gains.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the
magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in,
obviously drunk.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yo- hooo!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Where the hell've you been?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are you drunk?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been
up here, I've been worried...</p>

<p>(Monica is drinking from the tap)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica? Monica!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Water rules!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if
you're gonna be showing up for work?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nope. Going to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em> today.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not
you!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the
pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much
more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!</p>

<p>(The phone rings and Rachel answers)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the
credit card people.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> They've arrested Monica.</p>

<p>[Scene: New York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How are you?</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you
know I was here?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> That I was not expecting.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Oh. Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you,
I would never have gotten to sing <em>Memories</em> on the stage at the <em>Wintergarden
Theater</em>!</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without
you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the <em>Big
Apple Circus</em>?</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other
women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em>?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, not... worried, just... wondering.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to
being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Not necessarily...</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish
thing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, I'm not actually Amish.</p>

<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Really? Then why are you like that?</p>

<p>[Scene: Tap Class, Monica is standing by the door.]</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> You by the door. In or out?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)</p>

<p><b>Teacher:</b> You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel.]</p>

<p><strong>PA:</strong> This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego,
boarding at gate 42A.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay,
but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San
Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just, just say what you feel.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Marcel, I'm hungry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That was good.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just,
y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.</p>

<p><strong>All: </strong>Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise
what he means and go to the other end of the room)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits
beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really
gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to
me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay,
Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two
seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.</p>

<p>(Marcel is put in a cage and taken away.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...</p>

<p><strong>Casting Director No. 1:</strong> That's fine, thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Casting Director No. 2:</strong> Next. (Joey walks onstage)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Shut up!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tell me what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look at you, you won't even look at him.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why
women won't look at me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you
and I, were...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Doing it on this table. (points at the table)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Exellent dream score.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why, why, why would you dream that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> More importantly, was I any good?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you were pretty damn good.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
(Monica pats him on his lap)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I love it, when we share.</p>

<p>(Ross goes over to the counter. Chandler follows him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're okay there?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was
somebody else's subconscious.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier, Chandler is sitting on the table.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Get off.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill
press?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know. What are you wearing?</p>

<p>(Chandler, Monica and Phoebe looks at him)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my
massage clients.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pirates again?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this
&quot;massage-yourself-at-home-workshop.&quot; And they are.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What... I could, I could do it. What is it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is
having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I could be a secretary.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because
it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I could do that.</p>

<p>(Ross's beeper goes off)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still
extinct.'</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I
mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> College?</p>

I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right,

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got
promoted, and, you know, now you're like &quot;Mr. Boss Man&quot;. You know, Mr. Bing. Mr.
Bing, &quot;Boss Man Bing&quot;.</p>

<p>(Joey and Ross laughs)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can't belive it.</p>

later?'</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did not.</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that
gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How was that possible?</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held

why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(They kiss)</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Unless...</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Yeah, I'd really like that.</p>

<p>(They kiss)</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something
you should know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly
married to a goat?'</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ethan?</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you a virgin?</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I
am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?</p>

<p>(They kiss)</p>

<p>[Time lapse. They are now in Monica's bedroom, on the bed.]</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You keep saying that.</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when
you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.</p>

<p>(They kiss)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And
I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no. Nothing wrong about that. </p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. </p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Huh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what
the hell does it matter how old we are.</p>

<p>(They kiss)</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another
one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You're not a senior?</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok...ay.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica's Bedroom, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't
alive during the Bicentennial.</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> I just had sex.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Well, you never told me how old you were.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48
states. What were you thinking?</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> ...in love with you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> (nods) Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school
night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm
Joan Collins.</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Who? </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone exept Monica is there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie,
bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, forget it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to
Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. (Moves closer.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it was just the three of us.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and
me and Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) You know what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> There were times when it wasn't even me.</p>

<p>(Chandler and Joey laughs, until they look at each other then recoil in horror.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)</p>

<p>(Monica enters, wearing a walkman, so she doesn't hear what the others say)</p>

<p><strong>Ross, Rachel, and</strong> <b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Mon.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?</p>

<p><strong>All:</strong> (shouting) Mon!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ethan called again.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you not seeing him anymore?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get
out of gym.</p>

<p>(Monica stares at Rachel)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He
stopped by.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the
strongest <em>Power Ranger</em> is?</p>

<p>(Ross and Chandler laughs)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?</p>

<p><strong>Joey, Chander, and</strong> <b>Ross:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's morphin time!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Stegosaurus!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tyrannosaurus!</p>

<p>(They all cross they're arms like the <em>Power Rangers</em> do)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then
I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Where are you going?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Work people? Nobody told me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know,
them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.
You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them.
Let them see what a great guy you still are.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You think I should?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I really do, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that
invited the boss.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's office, he and Phoebe are taking a break from work.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I
doing <em>Ebony and Ivory</em>.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You were great. But they still made fun of you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, now you're more like, you know like, &quot;Mr. Caring
Boss,&quot; &quot;Mr.&quot;, you know, &quot;I'm one of you, Boss,&quot; &quot;Mr., I
wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then, I don't get it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like,
the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them...
They still say you're a great boss.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> They do?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I just wan't to...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, but you can't.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But I just wa...</p>

off and everyone exept him react.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aren't you gonna...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's
having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What about Andr?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin
Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.</p>

<p>(Ethan enters)</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That was gonna be my opener.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys
check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I thought that was just a rumour.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> True story.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They're here already?</p>

<p>(Rachel, Ross and Ross go to the bathroom)</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only
said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have
a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can
talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I
thought that was great.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It was.</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Then, what's the problem?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ethan, it's um... it's icky.</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you
were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times,
I would really...</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> No, don't say it. (closes Monica's mouth with his hand)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> ...love you.</p>

<p>(Ross, Rachel and Joey come back from the bathroom. They discover that Monica and Ethan
aren't finished talking to each other yet.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you're hands still wet?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, moist, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let's dry 'em again.</p>

<p>(They go to the bathroom again)</p>

<p><b>Gerston:</b> No problem.</p>

<p>(They go away, trying very hard not to laugh at Chandler)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston,
Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Petrie.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...&nbsp; Wow!</p>

<p>[Scene: The hospital, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are in the waiting room,
waiting for Carol and Susan to arrive.] </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not
here.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the
mucus plug.</p>

<p>(Joey makes a sound of absolute disgust.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do we have to know about that?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the
50's.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first
contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.</p>

<p>(Everyone looks at Rachel as though she made a tasteless comment.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, it's ok when Chandler does it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You have to pick your moments.</p>

<p>(Phoebe arrives, guitar in hand.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Did I miss it, did I miss it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She's not even here yet.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What's with the guitar?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get
musical.</p>

<p>(Carol and Susan arrive.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Carol) Where the hell have you been?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> We stopped at the gift shop.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a <i>Chunky</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Susan wanted a <i>Chunky</i>. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't
stop for <i>Chunky</i>s.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I used to have that bumper sticker.</p>

<p>(Everyone is amused by Chandler's comment.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Rachel) You see what I mean.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Carol's Hospital Room, Carol is on the bed, Ross and Susan are at her side.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Stopped for a <i>Chunky</i>.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Let it go, Ross.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> I got an extra one. You want this? (holds the candy in front of Ross'
face)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (weakly) No.</p>

<p>(Carol's doctor, Dr. Franzblau arrives.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Dr. Franzblau, hi.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see
you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 59 seconds. (holds up his watch) Quartz, ha.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Swiss quartz, ha, ha.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Am I allowed to drink anything?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'll get it.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I got it&#151;I'm getting it!</p>

<p>(They both leave just as Rachel enters the room, holding a cup.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And if you need anything else, I&#151;(notices the handsome Dr.
Franzblau)&#151;do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's...
ex-husband's... sister's roommate. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's...

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit
water if he was standing on a boat.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah? And who do you like?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> The Celtics.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We
need a father!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin'
in here.</p>

<p>(A woman passes by, carrying newborn twins.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You'll get one.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yeah? When?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are
married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why won't I be married when I'm 40?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (trapped) Uh, uh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back
of the chair he was sitting in)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did you go home and change?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr.
Franzblau been by?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, I haven't seen him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby
needs him?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your
father a doctor? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, why?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Lydia in the hospital room. Lydia is on the phone with her mother.]</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it
is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. (pause) What do you mean,
Joey who? (covers the phone, to Joey) Joey who?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Tribbiani.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. (to Joey) She wants to talk to you.
Take the phone.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're just
friends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> She's not much of a phone person.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if
someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ok, look, maybe I should just go.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Maybe you should.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? </p>

<p>(He leaves, but then returns a moment later.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Oh, that is so not true.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, it is.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> It isn't.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It is.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Isn't!</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol's Hospital Room, Ross and Susan are coaching Carol.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Breathe.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Breathe.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Breathe.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Breathe.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Breathe.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Breathe.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> You're gonna kill me!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Count faster.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep
focusing on Jordie.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who the hell is Jordie?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Your son.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is
Jamie.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to
Jordie.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,<b> back</b> to Jordie? We
never <b>landed</b> on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan
fiasco.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I got it.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> I got it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> No, you don't.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> All right, that's it. I want both of you out.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> He started it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, you started it.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> You did!</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're
not making it any easier.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But...</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Now go!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Susan) Thanks a lot.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> (to Ross) See what you did.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Carol) Yeah, listen...</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> <b>Out</b>! </p>

<p>(Ross and Susan both angrily leave the hopsital room.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Lydia's Hospital Room, Joey is helping Lydia go through labor, a nurse is now
present in her room as well.]</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> Breathe, breathe, breathe...</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Oh, no.</p>

<p>(Joey looks down at Lydia.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ew! What is that? Something exploded!</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> (to Joey) Breathe, breathe, breathe.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hall, Ross and Susan are arguing.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Please. This is so your fault.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> How, how is this my fault?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I'm threatened by you?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Yes.</p>

<p>(Phoebe has heard them arguing and comes down the hall, taking them into a broom
closet.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you
guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building
and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just
stop all the yelling, just stop it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, Susan.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.</p>

<p>(Phoebe goes to leave the room, but the door is locked.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The Broom Closet, Ross and Susan are trying to get out.]</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Help!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as if
he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow.</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol's room, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau are there with her.]</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Are they here yet?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find
them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ok.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ok.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it
sounds fascinating.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by
my hotel. (Carol sits up in pain, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau casually lay her back down)
There you go, dear. </p>

<p>[Scene: Lydia's Room, Joey is helping her deliver.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder,
harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey,
hey, ho, ho. Let's&#151; (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I was
just&#151;yeah, right. Push! Push! </p>

<p>[Scene: The Broom Closet, Ross has picked up a vacuum and is holding it at the door.]</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> What're you gonna do, suck the door open?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Help! Help!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) <i>They found their bodies the very next day, they found their
bodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la la la la.</i></p>

<p><b>Susan and Ross:</b> (even louder) Help!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Waiting Room, Monica is on the phone with her mother, Chandler is standing
behind her.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is
great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you
don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance?
(Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. </p>

<p>(Monica sees a woman pass by with a baby, puts the phone to her chest, and starts to
cry. Chandler takes the phone, makes a noise in it resembling static, and hangs up. Joey
enters.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where have you been?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, just had a baby.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Mazel tov!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Waiting Room, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau have gone to get coffee.]</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's
doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you
know, where I do.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard,
when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm a waitress.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the
end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> I'm gonna go check up on your friend.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hall Outside Lydia's Room, Joey is walking up to Lydia's room with
balloons, but before he enters he sees that the baby's father has arrived. He listens at
the door.]</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> So how did you know I was even here?</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Your mom called me. So is this her?</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> No, this is a loaner.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. (Joey
smiles) So, did you see who won the game?</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.</p>

<p><b>Lydia:</b> Yeah, they're not so bad.</p>

<p>(Joey closes the door and ties the balloons to the knob. Then he walks away, holding
the hand of an inflated balloon animal he had brought.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Broom Closet, Ross is trying to open the door with a credit card, with no
success.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all
your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is
being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just
as much as you have.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have,
ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with
the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is so great.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You wanna explain that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my
mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to
make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care
about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not
even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm
sorry, you were fighting.</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol's Room, she is ready to give birth. Everyone is there except for Phoebe,
Ross, and Susan, who are in the broom closet.]</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Where are they?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sure they'll be here soon.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) You are really frightening me.</p>

<p>(Carol suddenly screams in pain and grabs Chandler by the shirt.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her
hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> All right, ten centimeters, here we go.</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> All right, honey, time to start pushing.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> But they're not here yet!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, god.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Broom Closet, Ross has used a broom to open the air vent in the ceiling.
Phoebe is wearing a janitor's uniform, ready to go up in the vent.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, got the vent open.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker
Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two,
three. Ok, That's it, Ben.</p>

<p>(Ross and Susan lift Phoebe up into the vent.)</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> What do you see?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in
fact a dark vent.</p>

<p>(A janitor opens the closet door from the outside.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebs, It's open! It's open!</p>

<p>(Ross and Susan run to the delivery room, leaving Phoebe dangling from the vent.)</p>

<p><b>Janitor:</b> (to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs!</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol's Room, Ross and Susan rush in.]</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Push, push!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We're here!</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (irked) Where have you been?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Long story, honey.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I
need&#151;(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I have
this?</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and
there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life
partner, out you go!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Good luck!</p>

<p>(Everyone heads for the door.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life
partner?</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> Out!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge.
Carol, how are you doing this?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (straining) Not.... helping!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Franzblau:</b> You're doing great, you're doing fine. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> What do you see? What do you see?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the
little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right!
Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Oh, look at that.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> What does he look like?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in <i>Jell-o</i>.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thanks, Pheebs!</p>

<p>(They look up towards the vent and wave at Phoebe.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Delivery Room, Carol is holding the infant.]</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (thinking) How 'bout Ben?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> I like Ben.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We uh, we just cooked it up.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> That's what we were off doing.</p>

<p>(Monica opens the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Can we come in?</p>

<p>(The whole gang enters.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Susan, he looks just like you.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, I still am one of these.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, can I?</p>

<p>(Monica holds Ben.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The head, the head. You gotta...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm
your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The Hospital, the camera is placed as though it were Ben's eyes.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be
around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this.
(returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still
always come back, like this. (returns) </p>

<p>(Chandler comes into the picture.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
(Does a baseball sign.)</p>

<p>(The rest of the group come into the picture.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He is so amazing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I know. Look at him.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he's
opening his eyes. (picture comes back) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He doesn't do much, does he?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, this is pretty much it.</p>

<p>(long moment of silence)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You guys wanna get some coffee?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, I'll see you guys later.</p>

<p>(They all leave but Ross, but they all come back a few seconds later. They make faces
at the baby.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.</p>

You must just want to kiss him all over!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pardon?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks
over to where Joey is seated)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe
me... 17 jillion dollars.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some...

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, just, y'know.... science.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued,
they all look over)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sigh)... It's a fertility study.</p>

<p>(Rachel laughs.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your <b>time</b>.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I
just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey,
but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.</p>

Monica)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it

<p><b>Joey:</b> He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Course there, they just call it food.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah... I guess. I don't&#151;I don't know. Alright, just... just give her
this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but...
I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.</p>

<p>[Time lapse. Melanie, Joey's girlfriend, is there with Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe,
and Rachel. Ross is gone.]</p>

<p><b>Melanie:</b> Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket
business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)</p>

<p>(Everyone follows Rachel to the living room. Monica pulls Joey aside.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're
gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...</p>

<p>(Monica rolls her eyes.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Then you do. Heh, heh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, uh, have you ever thought about being there <b>for her</b>?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know, just be there <b>for her</b>.</p>

<p>(Long pause... Joey looks confused.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Not following you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Think about it.</p>

<p>(They both walk over to where Rachel is opening her gifts. Rachel sees her first gift
is a fruit basket.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, I'm guessing this is from...</p>

<p>(Melanie smiles.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, thank you, Melanie.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles...
it's... (opens it) <i>Travel Scrabble</i>! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)</p>

<p>(Chandler looks dejected. Rachel picks up another gift.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels
like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.</p>

<p><b>Melanie:</b> There is a little child inside this man!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.</p>

<p>(Rachel picks up the next gift.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who's this from?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that's Ross's. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Remembered what?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw
this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was
a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his <i>Travel
Scrabble</i> game)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can't believe he did this.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with
Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?</p>

<p>(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just spilled the beans about Ross's crush on
Rachel. You can hear this entire classic scene by clicking here.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What did you just say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.... my God.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head.
That'll turn back time.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, this is unbelievable.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. This is really, really huge.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever
again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK, is there a mute button on this woman?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something
about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else
did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't
mind getting a cup of coffee or something.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (quickly) H-He's in China!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> The country.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for
another forty-five more minutes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What about the time difference?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> From here to the airport?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I-I-I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well then maybe you shouldn't go. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the
kind of thing that can wait.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Here, look, alright, does this help?</p>

<p>(Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.
I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta...
OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)</p>

<p>[Scene: Airport, Ross has headphones on, and is listening to a 'How To Speak Chinese'
tape. Occasionally, he makes an outburst in Chinese in accordance with the tape. He is
getting on the jetway. The flight attendant is there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (something in Chinese)</p>

<p><strong>Flight Attendant: </strong>Alright!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)</p>

<p>(Rachel runs into the airport, trying to catch Ross, moving people out of the way.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....</p>

<p>(Rachel gets up to the jetway.)</p>

<p><strong>Flight Attendant</strong>: Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> May I see your boarding pass?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.</p>

<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless
you have a boarding pass.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I know, but I&#151;he just went on. He's right there, he's got the
blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...</p>

<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> No no no! Federal regulations!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a
message for me? Please? This is <b>very</b> important.</p>

<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> Alright. What's the message?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh... I don't know.</p>

<p>[Cut to the Jetway, the flight attendant enters, walks past Ross, and approaches an
older man with his wife who is also wearing a blue jacket.]</p>

<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.</p>

<p><b>Man:</b> (confused) What?</p>

<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she
will see you when you get back.</p>

<p><b>Man:</b> (to wife): Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking
about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's Bedroom, he and Melanie are in bed together.]</p>

<p><b>Melanie:</b> Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a
minute!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Heh, heh. It was nothin'.</p>

<p><b>Melanie:</b> Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing
his chest)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give
you another turn.</p>

<p><b>Melanie:</b> (surprised) M-Me again?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure! Why not?</p>

<p><b>Melanie:</b> Boy, somebody's gonna get a <b>big</b> fruit basket tomorrow.</p>

<p>(Joey starts to kiss her.)</p>

<p><b>Melanie:</b> Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Melanie:</b> I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys
who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I
ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Monica is holding
the wrapping paper from one of Rachel's gifts.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,
it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw
it out?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and
I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's <b>Ross</b>.
Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's <b>Ross</b>.</p>

<p><strong>Monica and Phoebe:</strong> Sure.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm
thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the
best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's
like starting on the fifteenth date!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth
date.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Another good point.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're
already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (confused) Huh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why isn't it working out?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is he not cute enough for you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Does he not make enough money?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I'm just....</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe there's someone else.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wha...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is there? Is there someone else?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! There is.. there is noone else!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is eating breakfast, Joey quietly opens his
bedroom door.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, big...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Shhhh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (quietly) ...spender.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She's still asleep.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So how'd it go?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know
me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me
great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was
like a ticker tape parade!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade
route.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all
of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was
able to appreciate it on another level.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I didn't know you had another level.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know! Neither did I!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, one week later. Monica is seated, Rachel comes out of her
bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, from who?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple
hours? At gate 27-B?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and
I've decided this&#151;this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be
going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't
wanna...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be
good. I promise.</p>

<p>(Door buzzer goes off. Rachel answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who is it?</p>

<p><b>Intercom:</b> It's me, Carl.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> C'mon up.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind
of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is seated, and the apartment is filled with
baskets of fruit. Joey enters, check in hand.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Seven hundred bucks!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I
learned something.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk
around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is having drinks with her date, Carl.]</p>

<p><b>Carl:</b> I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that <b>stupid</b>
electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against
environmental issues <b>per se</b>.... it's just that guy!</p>

<p>(Rachel looks bored. At this point, Ross&#151;a figment of Rachel's imagination&#151;
shows up on the balcony and starts talking to her.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine, just stop thinking about me.</p>

<p>(She tries, and Ross disappears momentarily. He reappears, standing closer to her.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Can't do it, can you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So I'm thinking about you. So what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....</p>

<p><b>Carl:</b> I mean, come on, buddy, get a <b>real car</b>!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, it's too hard.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares
about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth
grade. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you're like my best friend.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> If we broke up, and I lost you...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (pause) No. But... it only has to happen <b>once</b>. Look, you and I both
know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you
attracted to me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, start looking. </p>

<p>(They kiss. Ross walks away, and then fades out.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>Carl:</b> Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this
hammerhead in traffic!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right! You're right!</p>

<p><b>Carl:</b> Heh... y'know?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You know what?</p>

<p><b>Carl:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so
sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her
drink) I mean&#151;I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry. </p>

<p>(Rachel leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Carl:</b> But...</p>

<p>[Scene: Airport. Madonna's <i>Take A Bow</i> plays in the background as Rachel waits at
the gate with flowers.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me,
sorry. Hi.</p>

<p>[Cut to the jetway, the old man who the flight attendant delivered Rachel's message to
gets off the plane, his wife still upset with him.]</p>

<p><b>Man:</b> For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!</p>

<p>(A Chinese woman getting off the plane drops one of her bags. Ross gets off next.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, hey, hey, I got that.</p>

<p>(Ross picks up the bag... then he and the woman kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> Oh, thanks, sweetie.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. </p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, they will. I just... uh...</p>

<p><strong>Ross and <b>Julie:</b></strong> Can't wait.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, they're gonna love you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is recapping last season, and as she talks we see a
montague of scenes from Ross and Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with
Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of
got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like &quot;forget about
her&quot; but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in
love with Rachel. She was like, &quot;Oh my god.&quot; So she went to the airport to meet
him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane
with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough
about us. So, how've you been?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p align="left">[Scene, The Airport, continued from last season, Rachel is waiting for
Ross to come of the plane, when she sees he's coming off with another woman.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me.
Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (seeing her) Rach!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with
the flowers.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're bleeding. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr.
Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly,
thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country.</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> (Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok.
Baggage claim? Ok.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is waiting for Rachel to return from the airport
with Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b>&nbsp; No way!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with
Ross! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all
right, what's bigger than huge?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Um, this?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Guys, you got your hair cut.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> 'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look
good. I love that voice.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm
around her. Cramp, cramp.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.</p>

<p>(She hits Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter)
You, you slowpokes!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my
sister Monica. This is Chandler.&nbsp; Phoebe.&nbsp; Joey, what up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What up?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Everyone, this is Julie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (out of breath) Julie.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Ohh. (Happily) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first
impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And bus.</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> Oh my god.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b>&nbsp; The screaming guy?</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b>&nbsp; And the spitting?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You gotta hear this story.</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 200 at least.</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b>&nbsp; ...and this guy...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away
the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I
can think about.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess
who's in charge of the dig. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just
kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Julie) It's an expression.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the
baby.</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> And then we've gotta get some sleep.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like
to be surprised.</p>

<p>(Ross and Julie exit)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Chandler enter.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Rach, can I get...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Did you talk to him?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Not yet.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then, no.</p>

<p>(He goes to sit down next to Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left
you, you were totally in love with, you know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that
kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> God?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It was you, pal.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, maybe it was God, doing me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But
then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never
would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you owe me one, big guy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Ross) Here's your lemonade.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I didn't order lemonade.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge
you for that. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So
uh, what did you find out?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm
sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by
himself!&nbsp; Without any outside help whatsoever.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How is that the silver lining?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You have to really wanna see it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and the gang is watching Sumo wrestling on TV.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.</p>

<p>[Cut to Phoebe and Monica in the kitchen.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if
they've changed it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, although now that's what I'm thinking.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, so what were you thinking?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I
thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh! No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control
freak.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No you're not.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.</p>

<p>(The phone rings.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's
Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Hello? Hi.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Needs some clothes altered?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He
did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All
right, when was 1990?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.&nbsp; You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits
down next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,
three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up
either. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> She didn't hang up either!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talking
to me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel! I'll just call her back. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (calls Julie back) Hi?&nbsp; Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen
to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's
Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with
it. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm still on &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think you
could close your eyes for just a sec?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What's goin' on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What stupid thing did you do?</p>

<p><strong>Paulo:</strong> (entering from Rachel's room) Bon giorno tutti!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your
way, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, how did this happen?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Where?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> At his apartment. Is this juice?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> People do stupid things when they're upset.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone
looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.</p>

<p>(Ross and Julie enter.)</p>

<p><strong>All:</strong> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi. Sorry we're late but we were&#151;well, there was touching.</p>

<p><strong>Paulo:</strong> (entering) Hey, hey Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?</p>

<p><strong>Paulo:</strong> I do Raquel.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel) So, uh, he's back.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, not a problem.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got
pants that need to be altered.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
He'll know what it means.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair
was so much shorter and cuter.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. Ok, but, but!&nbsp; You have to promise that you will not be
all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I promise.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get
cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is finishing with her haircut and Monica is whincing.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, that's it, I quit.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What? I didn't say anything.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who
trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know,
doesn't trust a person.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we
had discussed.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How who wears it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Demi Moore.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Demi Moore is not a he.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he was a he in <em>Arthur</em>, and in <em>Ten</em>.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.&nbsp; Oh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh my God!</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> She's the act<strong>ress</strong> that was in <em>Disclosure</em>, <em>Indecent
Proposal</em>, <em>Ghost</em>!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> <strong>I know</strong>!</p>

<p>[Scene: Frank's tailor shop, Chandler is getting his pants measured.]</p>

<p><strong>Frankie:</strong> How long do you want the cuffs?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> At least as long as I have the pants.</p>

<p>(Pause as Frankie resumes his work.)</p>

<p><strong>Frankie:</strong> I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.</p>

<p>(He slowly measures it up his leg, and Chandler makes a rather surprised face.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is recovering from her haircut, Phoebe is playing
her doctor and is coming in from the bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How is she?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How's the hair?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on
one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Can we see her?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't
you come on in. </p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong>&nbsp; Yeah. (Gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that
meant.)</p>

<p>(They go into the bedroom leaving Joey and Rachel alone.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How're you doing?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, that bad, huh? </p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's
one of my gifts.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock
bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You gotta tell Ross how you feel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been
in love with you for like 10 years.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been
with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the
way Ross felt about you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause)
Your tailor is a very bad man!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Frankie? What're you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the
shoulder which causes him to jump.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand
up my leg, and then, there was definite...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Cupping.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over,
then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler
and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure
pants?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, later that day.&nbsp; Monica is now out and about.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. My hair is very amused.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between
the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Chandler and Ross) Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by &quot;bye!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, can I talk to you for a sec? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's ok.</p>

<p>[Out on the balcony]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's goin' on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a
stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um,
second of all (Ross is laughing), what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those
things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next
day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. No-no-no-no.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I
actually&#151;I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a
guy like that. </p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Ross: </strong>You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets
how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who
wakes up every morning thinking &quot;Oh my god, I'm with Rachel&quot;. You know, someone
who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer, but hearing
that she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I think that was the whole all.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Okay.&nbsp; Okay. (They hug.) Okay.</p>

<p>[Cut back inside, Joey is on the phone.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Julie is wanting to get her hair cut from Phoebe.]</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie
McDowell's new haircut?</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh yeah!&nbsp; Oh, I can do that.</p>

<p><strong>Julie:</strong> Really?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You wanna do it right now?</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> Great! (Julie leaves)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's
the girl from<em> Four Weddings and a Funeral</em>, right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy
from <em>Planet of the Apes</em>.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were
unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I
couldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God,
oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Oh, is he hungry already?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him)
something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (joins him) I gotta get one, too.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in
the world.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better
get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask
questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.</p>

<p>(They go back into the living room)</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> Carol?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about
breast-feeding?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, does it hurt?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> It did at first, but not anymore.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, uh, how often can you do it?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> As much as he needs.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get
bigger?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh,
we play. It's like we're father and son.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. (Ross looks at her.) Don't look so
surprised. I'm a lovely person.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, this is so cute.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Oh, I got that for him.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My mommies love me. That's clever.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju&#151;(Sees Rachel is watching)&#151;Hi, Jew! (Walks
into the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure,
that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Did you just say Hi, Jew?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes
it. Reaffirms his faith.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Rachel, and Joey are eating, and Phoebe is
preparing Ben's milk.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ben, dinner!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's
breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her
wrist and tastes it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What did you just do?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I licked my arm, what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's breast milk.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What did you just do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You won't even taste it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.&nbsp; Rachel is entering the living room from
her bedroom as Monica enters.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, where is everybody?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks
for your jacket.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in the
pocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and
notices she also grabbed a receipt.)</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53
dollars?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Judy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Julie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Jody!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You were with Julie?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she
was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we
were...shopping.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Oh my God. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, right.&nbsp; Sure!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry,
all right. I never meant for you to find out!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That is not true!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to <em>Bloomingdale's</em>?
(Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with
you right now. (Exits.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ben is playing in his crib while Chandler and Ross are
leaning against the rim and are completely asleep.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not as
simple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve.</p>

<p>(There's a knock on the door which is answered by Phoebe.)</p>

<p><strong>Carol and Susan:</strong> Hey! (This wakes Chandler and Ross up)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> How did we do?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I did not freak out. </p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Why'd you freak out?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Because it's breast milk. It's gross.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> My breast milk is gross?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> This should be fun.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
(Holding out a bottle.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (jumping away) That would be no.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on. It doesn't taste bad.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Cantaloupe juice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Uh huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you've tasted it.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and
Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it
off.) </p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is wiping down the peninsula counter as Joey
enters dressed like a cowboy.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Howdy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a
juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people
on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes
through two bottles a day.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you
care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs
the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that.
You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And
then where're you gonna run?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah I guess you're right.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made
of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west
of the lingerie.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice
hooker.</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Rachel is cleaning up and Monica is pleading with her.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't know what else to say.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I feel terrible, I really do.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spend
some time together. Is that so terrible?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's that terrible?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy
who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually
(starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean,
just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,
(starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I love you too. (They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with
me, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes and
sits down.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to
hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a
guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.
Would you just give that a chance, for me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Department Store, Joey and the Hombre man are facing off in Joey's
section.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'.</p>

<p><b>Hombre Man:</b> I heard ya.</p>

<p><b>Store Guy:</b> All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?</p>

<p><b>Hombre Man:</b> Ready.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I'm ready.</p>

<p>(An old West style showdown starts with Joey and the Hombre Man staring each other down
as the store guy slowly lets in the first customer while Joey and the Hombre Man get ready
to draw.&nbsp; In slow motion they spot the customer, eye each other, draw, and as the
customer walks into the middle Joey's bottle misfires but the Hombre Man spays it into the
customer's eyes.)</p>

<p><b>Customer:</b> You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!</p>

<p><b>Store Guy:</b> Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?</p>

<p><b>Hombre Man:</b> I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Annabelle:</b> (seeing the end result) My god, what happened?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?</p>

<p><b>Annabelle:</b> Sure.</p>

<p>(They walk off into the sunset, at least a picture of one.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Julie and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you
know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us,
though, right?</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really? Me?</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really
wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the
feeling that maybe you don't.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you're not totally paranoid.</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> Oy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it
was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but
um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,
Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or
something?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.</p>

<p><b>Julie:</b> I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, Julie.</p>

<p><strong>Julie:</strong> Bye. (Gets up.)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Bye. (After Julie exits.) What a manipulative bitch.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p align="left">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, another showdown is occuring, only this time
its between Ross, a plate of cookies, and the breast milk.&nbsp; They've been eyeing each
other for a while now, and Chandler and Joey are getting bored.&nbsp; He checks his Ross
and in frustration, shoves his watch in front of Ross's eyes as if saying, &quot;Hurry it
up already!&quot;&nbsp; Finally, Ross scratches his head, does that again, itches his
nose, scratches his head, grabs the bottle, takes a big swig, and piles several cookies
into his mouth.]</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Hey.</p>

<p>MONICA: So how was Joan?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I broke up with her. </p>

<p>CHANDLER: They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Come on, they were not that huge.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.</p>

<p>MONICA: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial
insignificant things?</p>

<p>JOEY: Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to
the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she
had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: You or me?</p>

<p>ROSS: I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.</p>

<p>JOEY: You guys are messin' with me, right?</p>

<p>ALL: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOEY: That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, &quot;whoa.&quot;</p>

<p>PHOEBE: You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Maureen Rosilla.</p>

<p>ROSS: Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.</p>

<p>(knock)</p>

<p>MONICA: Hello, Mr. Heckles.</p>

<p>MR. HECKLES: You're doing it again.</p>

<p>MONICA: We're not doing anything.</p>

<p>MR. HECKLES: You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.</p>

<p>RACHEL: You don't have birds.</p>

<p>MR. HECKLES: I could have birds.</p>

<p>MONICA: Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.</p>

<p>MR. HECKLES: Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.</p>

<p>RACHEL: All right, bye-bye.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.</p>

<p>ROSS: We'll give you Janice.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I miss Janice though. &quot;Hello, Chandler Bing.&quot;</p>

<p>RACHEL: &quot;Oh, my, god.&quot;</p>

<p>JOEY: &quot;Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!&quot;</p>

<p>MONICA: Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.</p>

<p>RACHEL: We won. We won!</p>

<p>MONICA: Mr. Heckles.</p>

<p>RACHEL: How did this happen?</p>

<p>MR. TREEGER: He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.</p>

<p>MONICA: That's terrible.</p>

<p>MR. TREEGER: I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS: Sure, sweepin'.
You never know.</p>

<p>MR. TREEGER: You never know.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the
light, Mr. Heckles!</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Ok, Phoebe.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You
know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not
true.</p>

<p>JOEY: Such as?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?</p>

<p>ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Nah. Not really.</p>

<p>ROSS: You don't believe in evolution?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a
nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.</p>

<p>ROSS: Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over
millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yeah, I just don't buy it.</p>

<p>ROSS: Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific
fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Ok, don't get me started on gravity.</p>

<p>ROSS: You uh, you don't believe in gravity?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know,
it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down
as I am being pushed.</p>

<p>(knock)</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.</p>

<p>MR. TREEGER: There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy
Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.</p>

<p>MONICA: What can we do for you?</p>

<p>MR. BOYLE: All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to
leave all his earthly possessions to &quot;the noisy girls in the apartment above
mine&quot;.</p>

<p>MONICA: Well, what about his family?</p>

<p>MR. BOYLE: He didn't have any.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ok, so let's talk money.</p>

<p>MR. BOYLE: All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one,
you be noisy girl number two.</p>

<p>MONICA: I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it
amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look
at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!</p>

<p>RACHEL: Have you ever seen so much crap?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap</p>

<p>JOEY: Check this out. Can I have this?</p>

<p>ROSS: How can you not believe in evolution?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!</p>

<p>ROSS: Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we
have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of
different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Really? You can actually see it?</p>

<p>ROSS: You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: See, I didn't know that.</p>

<p>ROSS: Well, there you go.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Hey, look at this. &quot;My Big Book of Grievances.&quot;</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a
date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the
dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.</p>

<p>MONICA: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.</p>

<p>RACHEL: What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything,
which, by the way, I also think is very cool.</p>

<p>MONICA: It doesn't go with any of my stuff.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Well, what about my stuff?</p>

<p>MONICA: You don't have any stuff.</p>

<p>RACHEL: You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?</p>

<p>MONICA: No.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents
a room.</p>

<p>MONICA: Mmmmm.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ok, while you &quot;mmm&quot; on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for
my new lamp.</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without
evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.</p>

<p>ROSS: Please tell me you're joking.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.</p>

<p>ROSS: No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--</p>

<p>PHOEBE: What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No,
what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.</p>

<p>ROSS: Is there blood coming out of my ears?</p>

<p>JOEY: Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Wow, he looks so normal.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: He's even kind of cute.</p>

<p>JOEY: &quot;Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in
school.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Funniest? Heckles? </p>

<p>JOEY: That's what it says.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you
listen to that?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I'd call that excessive.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Whoa! </p>

<p>JOEY: What?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the
scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were
cool.</p>

<p>JOEY: So, you were both dorks. Big deal.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and
Heckles...Would you knock it off?</p>

<p>JOEY: Have you been here all night?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what
he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when
she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he
did.</p>

<p>JOEY: Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years
behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.</p>

<p>JOEY: All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll
buy you breakfast, let's go.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped
her because she pronounced it &quot;supposably&quot;?</p>

<p>JOEY: Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: How do you know that? How?</p>

<p>JOEY: I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end
up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for
holidays?</p>

<p>JOEY: Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're
at her folks' place?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yeah, I understand.</p>

<p>JOEY: You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.</p>

<p>JOEY: Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: (on phone) Hi, it's me.</p>

<p>JANICE: Oh, my, god.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Janice? You called Janice?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?</p>

<p>ROSS: You remember Janice, right?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice
is my last chance to have somebody.</p>

<p>JANICE: Helloo!!</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Oh, my, god!</p>

<p>JOEY: Geez, look how fat she got.</p>

<p>JANICE: Hey, it's everybody.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Janice, you're--</p>

<p>JANICE: Yes, I am.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Is it--?</p>

<p>JANICE: Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady
now.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Congratulations.</p>

<p>JANICE: Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?</p>

<p>JANICE: And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.</p>

<p>MONICA: Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?</p>

<p>RACHEL: What?</p>

<p>MONICA: Hide the Lamp.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Monica, let it go.</p>

<p>MONICA: Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A
briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying
that it's one of the possibilities.</p>

<p>ROSS: It's the only possibility, Phoebe.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time
when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like
what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it
open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so
unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you
could be wrong about this?</p>

<p>ROSS: There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I can't believe you caved.</p>

<p>ROSS: What?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree
with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work
tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to
face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?</p>

<p>RACHEL: I am. Let me just get my coat.</p>

<p>MONICA: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my
jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden,
it's just magically broken?</p>

<p>MONICA: Phoebe, tell her!</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to
believe you.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Neat. I'm gonna die alone.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ok, you win.</p>

<p>MONICA: Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Uh huh. Why is that?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook,
like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a
Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will
walk past my place, they will run. &quot;Run away from Crazy Snake Man,&quot; they'll
shout!</p>

<p>MONICA: You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with
me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone
out with.</p>

<p>MONICA: You are not a freak. You're a guy.</p>

<p>RACHEL: She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.</p>

<p>MONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: In a bad way?</p>

<p>MONICA: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even
have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate
with someone.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!</p>

<p>MONICA: You made it!</p>

<p>PHOEBE: You're there!</p>

<p>RACHEL: You are ready to make a commitment!</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Whoa! Don't know about that.</p>

<p>RACHEL: What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?</p>

<p>MONICA: No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look
good in our apartment.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Thank you.</p>

<p>MONICA: That's fine.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night.
This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been
holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But,
I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I'll take that.</p>

<p>JOEY: You want his yearbook?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody
should have it.</p>

<p>MONICA: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and
now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr.
Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to
hell.</p>

<p>RACHEL: It's really not that big!</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Takin' that with you, huh?</p>

<p>JOEY: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>ROSS: You comin'?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.</p>

<p>ALISON: Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the
classifieds and see &quot;Philosopher wanted&quot;?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office.
Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get
hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: Nice smile, good
dresser...Big head, big head, big head!)</p>

<p align="left">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is on the phone.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking
alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street,
this is a safe building, there's nothing [a pigeon flies in the window and lands on the
table] OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. [hangs up] OK,
that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. [grabs a pot
and lid] OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. [puts pot over
the pigeon] Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God, aaaaahh. [knock at the door] It's open you guys.<br>
<br>
[a stranger enters with flowers]<br>
<br>
STRANGER: Hi.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hi, hi can I help you?<br>
<br>
STRANGER: Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.<br>
<br>
STRANGER: Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. [leaves flowers on bar]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What? [in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot and lets it get away]<br>
<br>
STRANGER: Hey, how, how did you do that?<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b>OPENING TITLES</b></font> <br>
[Scene: Monica and Rachels apartment. The whole gang is there.]<br>
<br>
JOEY: This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Well, I mean, I'm not <i>married</i> married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's
gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived
together, we told each other everything.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and
you would not approve.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who,
hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?<br>
<br>
ROSS: You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat
a cheeseburger.<br>
<br>
ALL: Huuh.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, didn't you?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I might have.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I can't believe you didn't tell me.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.<br>
<br>
MONICA: What have I not told you?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the
telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What!<br>
<br>
MONICA: Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are
dead meat.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't
know, having a third nipple.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: You have a third nipple?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: You bitch.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Whip it out, whip it out.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?<br>
<br>
JOEY: I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?<br>
<br>
JOEY: I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let
me see it again.<br>
<br>
ALL: Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Joey was in a porno movie.<br>
<br>
ALL: Huuh.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.<br>
<br>
ROSS: You were in a porno?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the
last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix
the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.<br>
<br>
MONICA: That is wild.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [to Chandler] So what's it shaped like?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, is there a hair on it?<br>
<br>
JOEY: What happens if you flick it?<br>
<br>
[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, and Julie are sitting on the couch.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the
magical land of Narnia.<br>
<br>
JULIE: You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.
You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?<br>
<br>
ROSS: You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: [to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with
her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I
just have to get over it.<br>
<br>
[Phoebe enters all dressed up]<br>
<br>
ALL: Woah.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Foxy lady.<br>
<br>
JULIE: Where you goin'?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the
Capades.<br>
<br>
JOEY: The Ice Capades?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls.
. . funny.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting
yourself up all over again.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling
behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look
nice for your gay husband.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [holding cream pitcher] Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front
of Chandler's chest and flips the lid] Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . . <br>
<br>
[Scene: Central Perk close to closing. Ross and Julie are still there. Rachel is cleaning
tables.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: OK sweetie, I'll see you later.<br>
<br>
JULIE: See you later Rach.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Bye-bye Julie. [Julie leaves]<br>
<br>
[Rachel is still cleaning, Ross is laying on the couch. Ross kicks Rachel in the butt.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hey.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hey.<br>
<br>
[Ross kicks her again]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hey, c'mon, cut it out.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hey?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Can I ask you somethin'?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Sure.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Naa.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What? C'mon, talk to me.<br>
<br>
ROSS: OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the
sex?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and
Julie not having sex?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Technically, huh, no.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like,
kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we,
we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No, no no no, don't need to know the details.<br>
<br>
ROSS: It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life
and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and
it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact
you know what I think?<br>
<br>
ROSS: What?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I think it's sexy.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Sexy?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does
not want to have sex.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No kidding?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?<br>
<br>
ROSS: What?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I'd wait.<br>
<br>
ROSS: You'd wait?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Really?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs,
she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just
means it's working.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Women really want this?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: More than jewelry. [Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself]<br>
<br>
[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Duncan's dressing room.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Hi.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Phoebe!<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ta-da.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Hey.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Hi.<br>

DUNCAN: Ahh, look at you, you look great.<br>

PHOEBE: Do I? Thank you, so do you.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Thanks.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I
remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: You always said I'd make it.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: I missed you. [they hug] I'm gonna get changed.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Um, now. Phoebs.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, right, OK. Ole.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: What?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Um, the matador. [Duncan leaves] Ole, ha ha ha.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross and Julie are setting the table.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. [hands her a bowl and kisses her]<br>
<br>
[Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel enter. Ross and Julie don't notice.]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Uh, Julie.<br>
<br>
JULIE: Yeah?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're
alright.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hi everyone.<br>
<br>
ALL: Hi.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [pulls Rachel aside] I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk
before.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What did, what did he say?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about
what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight
so. . .<br>
<br>
[Scene: Ross's apartment. After dinner. Chandler enters.]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Pop it in.<br>
<br>
JOEY: I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled
people. [Chandler puts the tape in]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.<br>
<br>
ROSS: What's wrong with people having sex?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and
females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Hell, I wanna see Joey.<br>
<br>
[video starts with the cheesy porn disco music]<br>
<br>
JULIE: So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.<br>
<br>
MONICA: All I say is, she better get the job.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to
the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And
then I say, wait, here's my line, [Joey from TV] <i>you know that's bad fo r the paper
tray</i>.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Nice work my friend.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin'
me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .<br>
<br>
[Scene: Madison Square Garden, Duncan's dressing room. Phoebe is fixing her hair and
Duncan enters.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ohh. . .K. How come?<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: What?<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Huuh.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Yeah, I know, I.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so
smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you
can't live a lie anymore.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: So how long have you known?<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed
to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just
tryin' to fit in.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: And um, and there's actually a, a woman?<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Her name's Debra.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college,
when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But
I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. <br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Sure.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six
years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: I'm, I'm still me.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?<br>
<br>
[Scene: Ross's apartment. Everyone is sitting around. Monica enters from bathroom.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: You know, it still smells like monkey in there.<br>
<br>
JULIE: That saves us a conversation.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.<br>

JOEY: Me too, we should get goin'.<br>

RACHEL: No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty.
Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Rachel, that's all we do.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?<br>
<br>
JULIE: What about Julie?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really
know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna
hear everything.<br>
<br>
JULIE: Well, that could take a while.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I got the time to get to know Julie.<br>
<br>
JOEY: I got time.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? [Rachel gives her a look from hell] That's
fine.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?<br>
<br>
JULIE: Well, in a nutshell. . .<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Madison Square Garden, Duncan's dressing room. Phoebe is signing the divorce
papers.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: So, um, have you told your parents?<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: [handing him the papers] Here you go. You know what, I just have one more
question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think
that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink
either answer would make me feel better.<br>
<br>
DUNCAN: I love you Phoebe. [they hug and kiss]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Ross's apartment. Julie is telling her live story.]<br>
<br>
JULIE: And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs.
Cobb.<br>
<br>
RAHCEL: Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?<br>
<br>
JULIE: No Cobb, as in cobb salad.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I'm goin' home.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What?<br>
<br>
[Outside in the hallway, Chandler, Joey, and Monica exit]<br>
<br>
JOEY: Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Goodnight.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh, no no, I am.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna,
are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?<br>
<br>
ROSS: I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.<br>
<br>
RAHCEL: OK, gook luck.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Wha, uhh, what?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first
time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.<br>
<br>
ROSS: OK, now I'm nervous.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Maybe you should put it off.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so
unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really
happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I know, yeah, sorry.<br>
<br>
ROSS: What, it's not your fault.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the
right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Really?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to,
I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know
really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and
look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to
happen.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [being drawn in by her talk] Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that
I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and
uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. [goes back in apartment]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ohh, God.<br>

<p><b>[Scene: At Chandler and Joey's. Ross and Chandler are there. Ross is watching
wrestling.]</b></p>

<p>ROSS: Man, I sure miss Julie.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got
there. <b>(phone rings)</b></p>

<p>ROSS: You ever figure out what that thing's for?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm
always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never
gets pinned. </p>

<p>(MACHINE--JOEY'S VOICE): Here comes the beep, you know what to do.</p>

<p>JADE: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this
number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's
been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve
to make this call, so you know what I did?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: What?</p>

<p>JADE: I got a little drunk...and naked.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Bob here.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: (on phone) What've you been up to?</p>

<p>JADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in
case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.</p>

<p>ROSS: I know.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I'm back.</p>

<p>JADE: So, are we gonna get together or what?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central
Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?</p>

<p>JADE: Great, I'll see you then.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.</p>

<p>ROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you
tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, &quot;hey, you're not Bob.&quot;</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open
arms of the wry stranger at the next table.</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh my god. You are pure evil.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.</p>

<p><b>(At Monica and Rachel's)</b></p>

<p>ROSS: (on phone) Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New
Mexico.</p>

<p>ALL: Hi, Julie!</p>

<p>RACHEL: (sarcastically) Hi, Julie.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like
20?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.</p>

<p>JOEY: Do we need a cake?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Look guys, I know it's a little steep.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yeah, whoosh!</p>

<p>CHANDLER: But it's Ross.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: It's Ross.</p>

<p>JOEY: All right.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey,
you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: You know, I think I might just.</p>

<p>RACHEL: So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?</p>

<p>JOEY: Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just
stay home and eat dust bunnies.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't
get that we don't make as much money as they do?</p>

<p>JOEY: Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying &quot;let's go here, let's go
there&quot;. Like we can afford to go here and there.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you
know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday
thing, it's for Ross.</p>

<p>JOEY: For Ross.</p>

<p>RACHEL: For Ross, Ross, Ross.</p>

<p>MONICA: (enters) Oh my god. </p>

<p>RACHEL: Hey.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hi.</p>

<p>RACHEL: What?</p>

<p>MONICA: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All
of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head
lunch chef, and guess who got the job.</p>

<p>JOEY: If it's not you, this is a horrible story.</p>

<p>MONICA: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very
much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go
out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for
my kidney? <b>(at Central Perk)</b></p>

<p>ROSS: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.</p>

<p>ROSS: That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she
was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.</p>

<p>ROSS: Go over there and tell that woman the truth.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: All right.</p>

<p>ROSS: Go.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Hi. </p>

<p>JADE: Hi.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.</p>

<p>JADE: Yes?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Whoever stood you up is a jerk.</p>

<p>JADE: How did you--?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird
and sensitive. Tissue?</p>

<p>JADE: Thanks.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.</p>

<p><b>(At Somplace Nice)</b></p>

<p>ROSS: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--</p>

<p>MONICA: Who is also in charge of purchasing.</p>

<p>ROSS: Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--</p>

<p>MONICA: Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.</p>

<p>ROSS: Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my
little sister--</p>

<p>MONICA: Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!</p>

<p>JOEY: Cool.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Let's see!</p>

<p>ROSS: That's fine, I'll just wait!</p>

<p>MONICA: Oh, sorry.</p>

<p>JOEY: Sorry, sorry.</p>

<p>ROSS: Monica! </p>

<p>(glasses clinking)</p>

<p>WAITER: Are we ready to order? </p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.</p>

<p>WAITER: Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my
seat.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Wow, look at these prices.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.</p>

<p>JOEY: What are these, like famous chickens?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late.
How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?</p>

<p>ROSS: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey,
Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't
tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.</p>

<p>ROSS: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?</p>

<p>WAITER: Do I dare ask?</p>

<p>MONICA: Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns. </p>

<p>ROSS: That sounds great. Same for me.</p>

<p>WAITER: And for the gentleman?</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the
nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?</p>

<p>WAITER: You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad.</p>

<p>WAITER: (whispers) And what will that be on the side of?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?</p>

<p>WAITER: And for you?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.</p>

<p>WAITER: Anything else?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish,
aren't you?</p>

<p>ROSS: (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Um, everyone?</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. </p>

<p>JOEY: Thank you.</p>

<p>ROSS: Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay. </p>

<p>MONICA: Oh, thank you!</p>

<p>ROSS: So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush
for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with
his like teeny pizza! It's just...</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Not for you.</p>

<p>MONICA: All right, what's goin' on?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think
it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Fine. All right, fine.</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: You can tell us. </p>

<p>ROSS: Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.</p>

<p>JOEY: Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we
don't have as much money as you.</p>

<p>MONICA: Ok.</p>

<p>ROSS: I hear ya. </p>

<p>CHANDLER: We can talk about that.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Well, then...Let's.</p>

<p>ROSS: I, I just never think of money as an issue.</p>

<p>RACHEL: That's 'cause you have it.</p>

<p>ROSS: That's a good point.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?</p>

<p>JOEY: 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole
Ross's birthday hoopla.</p>

<p>ROSS: Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of
negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.</p>

<p>MONICA: If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll
just do the gift.</p>

<p>ROSS: G-gift? The thing's not the gift?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.</p>

<p>ROSS: Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.</p>

<p>ROSS: No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be
together.</p>

<p>MONICA: All of us.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Together.</p>

<p>ROSS: Not at the concert.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ok.</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Thank you.</p>

<p>JOEY: Thanks.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?</p>

<p><b>(at Monica and Rachel's)</b></p>

<p>CHANDLER: Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?</p>

<p>MONICA: I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh, it's like a skit.</p>

<p>MONICA: Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. </p>

<p>ROSS: Whoo!</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Cool.</p>

<p>MONICA: Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks
as sort of a thank-you.</p>

<p>ROSS: But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.</p>

<p>ROSS: Come on.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!</p>

<p>MONICA: It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: So...Thank you.</p>

<p>ROSS: Could you be less enthused?</p>

<p>JOEY: Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--</p>

<p>MONICA: Like?</p>

<p>JOEY: Charity.</p>

<p>MONICA: Charity?</p>

<p>ROSS: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.</p>

<p>ROSS: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how
you feel.</p>

<p>JOEY: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place
right now.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Me neither.</p>

<p>JOEY: Me too.</p>

<p>MONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and
stuff.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?</p>

<p>MONICA: Well, I guess now we can't go.</p>

<p>RACHEL: What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything
together?</p>

<p>MONICA: You know what? You're right.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Fine.</p>

<p>ROSS: Fine.</p>

<p>JOEY: Fine.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Fine.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Fine.</p>

<p>MONICA: All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.</p>

<p>ROSS: Chandler! </p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yeah?</p>

<p>ROSS: Geez! Are you ready?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.</p>

<p>ROSS: Whoa! You had sex today?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She
was biting her lip to stop from screaming. </p>

<p>ROSS: Wow.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.</p>

<p>(phone rings)</p>

<p>ROSS: Still doing the screening thing?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.</p>

<p>MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.</p>

<p>JADE: Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt
when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Bob here.</p>

<p>JADE: Oh, hi.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: So, uh, you met someone, huh?</p>

<p>JADE: Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. </p>

<p>CHANDLER: So, uh, how was he?</p>

<p>JADE: Eh.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Eh?</p>

<p>JADE: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from
screaming your name.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.</p>

<p>JADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.</p>

<p>ROSS: (silently mouthing) Bumpy?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar
with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.</p>

<p>JADE: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>(at the concert)</b></p>

<p>MONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.</p>

<p>ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: So, let's go.</p>

<p>ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.</p>

<p>MONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.</p>

<p><b>(at Monica and Rachel's)</b></p>

<p>JOEY: Come on you guys, one more time.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Ok. One.</p>

<p>JOEY: Nooo.</p>

<p>ROSS: Excellent, that was excellent.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I can't believe the guys missed this.</p>

<p>ROSS: What guys? Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?</p>

<p>MONICA: Do I know you?</p>

<p>STEVE: You used to be my babysitter.</p>

<p>MONICA: Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?</p>

<p>STEVE: Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.</p>

<p>MONICA: You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.</p>

<p>STEVE: Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.</p>

<p>MONICA: Uh, wait, backstage?</p>

<p>STEVE: Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.</p>

<p>ROSS: Ross.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Chandler.</p>

<p>STEVE: How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of
the ones who fooled around with my dad?</p>

<p><b>(at Central Perk)</b></p>

<p>ROSS: Hey, you guys.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Happy birthday.</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?</p>

<p>MONICA: Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?</p>

<p>MONICA: Uh, good.</p>

<p>ROSS: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a
hickey?</p>

<p>MONICA: No, I just, I fell down.</p>

<p>RACHEL: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?</p>

<p>MONICA: You know, a party, or--</p>

<p>RACHEL: What party?</p>

<p>ROSS: It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and,
and the band.</p>

<p>JOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?</p>

<p>MONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh!</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you
know, all, &quot;hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck&quot;.</p>

<p>ROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.</p>

<p>RACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?</p>

<p>(Monica's pager goes off)</p>

<p>MONICA: It's work.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But
we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it. </p>

<p>JOEY: And we don't work hard?</p>

<p>MONICA: (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.</p>

<p>JOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yes.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh!</p>

<p>CHANDLER: No.</p>

<p>MONICA: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift
from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget
the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh.</p>

<p>(Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)</p>

<p>WAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.</p>

<p>JOEY: Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?</p>

<p>MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.</p>

<p>JADE: Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been
3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night
together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...</p>

<p>(Joey lunges for phone and misses.)</p>

MONICA: Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't
cry. Why is he still crying?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Let me hold him for a sec. There. (Ben stops crying) Huh? There we are.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Maye it's me.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.<br>
<br>
ROSS: There we go. All better. (gives Ben back to Monica)<br>
<br>
MONICA: There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries.
When he moves Ben away, he stops crying.)<br>
<br>
JOEY: Cool.<br>
<br>
MONICA: He hates me. My nephew hates me.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Come on, don't do this.<br>
<br>
MONICA: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before
you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet.
Joey, she does not look fat.<br>
<br>
(Chandler has a basketball which he is moving closer to, then away from, Monica)<br>
<br>
JOEY: Goo, goo, goo, waaah!<br>
<br>
MONICA: That is so funny. Let me see that. (throws the ball out the window)<br>
<br>
JOEY: Are you ok, Ross?<br>
<br>
ROSS: I don't know. What's in this pie? <br>
<br>
MONICA: Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- <br>
<br>
ROSS: Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. <br>
<br>
ROSS: And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ugh.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh my god.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Is your tongue swelling up?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.<br>
<br>
MONICA: All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Is he gonna be ok?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.<br>
<br>
ROSS: You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone
for Thcrabble?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Jacket now.<br>
<br>
ROSS: What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: We'll watch him.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I don't think tho.<br>
<br>
JOEY: What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on,
we wanna do it, don't we?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and
there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hat, milk, got it.<br>
<br>
ROSS: ??? (speech garbled) Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!<br>
<br>
JOEY: Consider it done.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: You understood that?<br>

JOEY: Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.<br>

PHOEBE: Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote
it this morning in the shower.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: (singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My
skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.<br>
<br>
TERRY: Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What's up?<br>
<br>
TERRY: F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday
afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: But what about Phoebe?<br>
<br>
TERRY: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want
to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.<br>
<br>
TERRY: Uh--<br>

repeat, as needed.<br>

<b>(Chandler and Joey are loaded down with baby stuff, and Ben)</b><br>
<br>
CHANDLER: You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the
baby's anvil?<br>
<br>
JOEY: It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women
love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o'
babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got
one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: No, I got him.<br>

CAROLINE: And who is this little cutie pie?<br>

CHANDLER: Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?<br>
<br>
JOEY: You wanna smell him?<br>
<br>
CAROLINE: I assume we're talking about the baby now.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.<br>

CAROLINE: I think my uterus just skipped a beat.<br>

JOEY: (to Chandler) What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?<br>
<br>
CAROLINE: I think it's great you guys are doing this.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, we are great guys.<br>
<br>
CAROLINE: You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three
years. What agency did you two go through?<br>
<br>
<b>(Central Perk)</b><br>
<br>
PHOEBE: But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in
chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a
throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying &quot;Terry's a jerk!&quot;
That's where that came from.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. <br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look,
look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you
won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.<br>
<br>
TERRY: I, I don't know. <br>
<br>
RACHEL: Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.<br>
<br>
TERRY: You don't clean the cappuccino machine?<br>

PHOEBE: Really?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a
professional.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well, but Pheebs.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You
know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay
to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need
your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and
thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. <br>
<br>
DOCTOR: Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia
about needles.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?<br>
<br>
MONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. <br>
<br>
DOCTOR: No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Tho?<br>
<br>
(Monica shakes her head.)<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ohhh.<br>
<br>
MONICA: That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just
gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ok.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross,
don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my
hand!<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to
the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, hey, look at that talent.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: (to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.<br>
<br>
GIRL 1 ON BUS: Hey, you. He's just adorable.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.<br>
<br>
GIRL 2 ON BUS: So what are you guys out doing today?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son
of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: You done?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah.<br>
<br>
GIRL 1: Oh, there's our stop.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Get outta here. This is our stop too.<br>
<br>
GIRL 2: You guys live around here too?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: You know it?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a
drink?<br>
<br>
GIRL 1: So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, sure, they love us over there.<br>
<br>
GIRL 2: Where's your baby?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER AND JOEY: (running after bus) Ben! Ben! Ben! <br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.<br>
<br>
BOTH: Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! <br>
<br>
MONICA: Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.<br>
<br>
DOCTOR: No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your
ring.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we
can celebrate later. Celebrate. <br>
<br>
PHOEBE: (singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the
professional guitar player?<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Yeah. I'm Stephanie.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Right. My name was on there, but now it just says &quot;carrot cake&quot;. So, um,
so um, how many chords do you know?<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: All of them. <br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, so you know D?<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Yeah.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ok, do you know A minor?<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Yeah.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Yeah.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: No.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello.
I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a
baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a
handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to
you again.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: (singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central
Perk!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever
loved. (singing) Zachary.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: (singing/screaming) You're all invited to bite me!<br>
<br>
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths
bus. Is he here? Is he here?<br>
<br>
TRANSIT AUTHORITY GUY: He's here. (Chandler and Joey hug each other in relief) I'm
assuming one of you is the father.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: That's me.<br>
<br>
JOEY: I'm him.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)<br>
<br>
BOTH (but to different babies): Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Please tell me you know which one is our baby.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was
definitely wearing ducks.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ok.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little
mole by his mouth.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Ahh!<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?<br>
<br>
JOEY: You got a better idea? <br>
<br>
CHANDLER: All right, call it in the air.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Heads.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Heads it is.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yes! Whew!<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: We have to assign heads to something.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?<br>
<br>

RACHEL: Hey.<br>

PHOEBE: Oh, hi.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Here. I thought you might be cold.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Thank you.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just
to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Do you?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I
don't know, when I sang &quot;Su-Su-Suicide&quot;, I got a dollar seventy-five. But then,
&quot;Smelly Cat&quot;, I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really
bad for Smelly Cat.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean,
if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's
like, it's just all about the money.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for
&quot;Smelly Cat&quot;.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Really? From who?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.<br>
<br>
KID: Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.<br>

PHOEBE: Yeah. Here you go.<br>

ROSS: Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?<br>

MONICA: Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?<br>

ROSS: Oh.<br>

MONICA: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped
over and hit your head on the curb? <br>
<br>
MONICA: No. But I remember people telling me about it.<br>

ROSS: I hope Ben has a little sister.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.<br>

ROSS: They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my
little boy. Hey, he's not crying.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: (looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying.<br>

(Ben starts crying)<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yes! There's still pie.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have
fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of
Human Services on his butt?<br>

STEPHANIE: (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's &quot;smelly cat, smel-ly cat&quot;.<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Better. Yeah.<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Yeah?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Yeah. <br>
<br>
PHOEBE: You wanna try it again?<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Yeah. From the top?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just
follow me?<br>
<br>
STEPHANIE: Ok.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Mmmm hmmm.<br>
<br>
TOGETHER: Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's

<p align="left">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Everyone is sitting at the couches,
Chandler enters.]<br>
<br>
CHAN: OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . .
repellant. . . about me?<br>
<br>
RACH: So, how was the party?<br>
<br>
CHAN: Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed <b>through</b> me. OK, so
what is it, am I hideously unattractive?<br>
<br>
PHOE: No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same
thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.<br>
<br>
CHAN: Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?<br>
<br>
PHOE: No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.<br>
<br>
MNCA: Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can
remake you.<br>
<br>
CHAN: Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.<br>
<br>
MNCA: Please.<br>
<br>
ALL: C'mon. Let her. Yeah.<br>
<br>
CHAN: Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours,
I'm goin' home.<br>
<br>
PHOE: Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here.
[hugs Chandler but holds her hands apart behind his back] Oh, can't make.... hands...
meet....<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b>OPENING TITLES</b></font> <br>
<br>
[Scene: Hallway between the apartments. Chandler comes out wearing spandex, jogging in
place. Monica is there.]<br>
<br>
CHAN: OK, let's do it. [Monica looks at him funny] What?<br>
<br>
MNCA: Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.<br>
<br>
CHAN: And we're changing. [jogs back in his apartment]<br>
<br>
[Cut to the city street. Monica and Chandler are jogging. Chandler is lagging behind so he
hops in a cab and takes off, leaving Monica behind]<br>
<br>
[Scene: Back in Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is doing situps.]<br>
<br>
MNCA: C'mon give me five more. Five more.<br>
<br>
CHAN: [weakly] No.<br>
<br>
MNCA: Five more and I'll flash you.<br>
<br>
CHAN: One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch. Rachel is working.]<br>
<br>
CHAN: [slowly lifts coffee cup to his mouth] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [slowly sets the
cup back down] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [Joey intercepts the cup and puts it down for him].
She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work.
She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.<br>
<br>
[Phoebe enters.]<br>
<br>
RACH: Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?<br>
<br>
PHOE: Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.<br>
<br>
JOEY: The guy still won't put out, huh?<br>
<br>
PHOE: Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.<br>
<br>
ALL: Sorry Phoebs.<br>
<br>
PHOE: Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really
interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I
mean.<br>
<br>
PHOE: No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Maybe he's. . . gay.<br>
<br>
PHOE: Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the
other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I
just like... definitely felt something.<br>
<br>
RACH: Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?<br>
<br>
PHOE: No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.<br>
<br>
[Monica enters.]<br>
<br>
MNCA: [to Chandler] Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
CHAN: Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.<br>
<br>
PHOE: [seeing Ross kissing Julie outside the window] Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.<br>
<br>
RACH: What? [looks, feigns indifference] C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date
tonight.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?<br>
<br>
RACH: Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.<br>
<br>
JOEY: But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?<br>
<br>
RACH: Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've
decided to opt for sanity.<br>
<br>
CHAN: So you really OK about all this?<br>
<br>
RACH: Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he
wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.<br>
<br>
[Ross and Julie enter.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hi guys.<br>
<br>
ALL: Hey.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy,
OK?<br>
<br>
MNCA: Only if you say his full name.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [reluctantly] Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.<br>
<br>
MNCA: Alright.<br>
<br>
JOEY: [to Ross] You're getting a cat?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.<br>
<br>
RACH: Together?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Uh huh.<br>
<br>
RACH: Both of you?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yep.<br>
<br>
RACH: Together.<br>
<br>
JULIE: Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.<br>
<br>
RACH: Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to
enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hopefully.<br>
<br>
RACH: Well. [looks at watch] Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um,
OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a,
uh, really good cat. [she leaves carrying her tray then comes back in] OK, we're not
supposed to take these when we leave.<br>
<br>
[Scene: A nice restraunt. Rachel is on her date with Michael (MICH).]<br>
<br>
MICH: I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my
divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.<br>
<br>
RACH: [distracted] How long do cats live?<br>
<br>
MICH: [confused] I'm sorry?<br>
<br>
RACH: Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or
something?<br>
<br>
MICH: Um, maybe 15, 16 years.<br>
<br>
RACH: That's just great. [she picks up her champagne and starts drinking]<br>
<br>
MICH: Um, cheers.<br>
<br>
RACH: Oh, right, clink. [downs her glass]<br>
<br>
MICH: Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?<br>
<br>
RACH: Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably
not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.<br>
<br>
MICH: Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.<br>
<br>
RACH: I mean he just started going out with her.<br>
<br>
MICH: Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?<br>
<br>
RACH: Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's
talk about you. <br>
<br>
MICH: Alright.<br>
<br>
RACH: OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?<br>
<br>
[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch.]<br>
<br>
PHOE: So, I figured it out.<br>
<br>
JOEY: What?<br>
<br>
PHOE: Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I
said, &quot;Excellent butt, great rack.&quot;<br>
<br>
PHOE: Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask
him.<br>
<br>
PHOE: You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. [they hug]<br>
<br>
[Outside the window, Monica and Chandler jog up. Monica playfully pushes him. They start
puching and slapping harder and harder until Monica pushes him down. Chandler stands up,
with a serious expression, and chases her away.]<br>
<br>
[Scene: Back in the restraunt. Rachel pours the last of the champange bottle in her
glass.]<br>
<br>
RACH: [obviously drunk] I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a <b>cat</b>. Why can't they get
one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day
or something? [belligerently] What're they called, what're they called, what're they
called?<br>
<br>
MICH: Fruitflies?<br>
<br>
RACH: Yes! Thank you.<br>
<br>
[The waiter comes to the table.]<br>
<br>
WAITER: So, would you like any dessert?<br>
<br>
MICH: No! No dessert, just a check, please.<br>
<br>
RACH: Oh, you're not having fun, are you?<br>
<br>
MICH: No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the
movie <i>Diner</i> in my head.<br>
<br>
RACH: Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can
think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why
can't I do that?<br>
<br>
MICH: Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't
see it now because you haven't had any closure.<br>
<br>
RACH: Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why
didn't I think of that? How do I get that?<br>
<br>
MICH: Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so
that you can finally say to him, &quot;I'm over you.&quot;<br>
<br>
RACH: Closure, that's what it is. Closure. [she looks around the restaurant, spotting a
guy with a cellular phone] Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo [she almost falls out
of her chair]<br>
<br>
GUY: Hang on.<br>
<br>
RACH: Hello, excuse me.<br>
<br>
GUY: What.<br>
<br>
RACH: Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.<br>
<br>
GUY: I'm talkin'!<br>
<br>
RACH: I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it
myself. [man is still reluctant] OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.<br>
<br>
GUY: Alright, fine. [on the phone] I'll call you back. [hands the phone to her]<br>
<br>
RACH: Thank you. OK. [dials] [to Michael] Machine. Just waiting for the beep.<br>
<br>
MICH: Good.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: [on phone] Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's
fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name
Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I
am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. [hangs up and tosses phone in
the ice bucket]<br>

<br>
RACH: Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .<br>

[Rachel looks at Ross as though she remembers something, but can't place what it is.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat
toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?<br>
<br>
RACH: I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't
remember.<br>
<br>
ROSS: OK. Oh, oh, oh. [runs over and picks up the cat toy]<br>
<br>
RACH: Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?<br>

RACH: Oh yeah, go ahead. [Rachel walks in her room. Ross picks up the phone and dials his
machine to check his messages.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Rach, I got a message from you. [pauses] Who's Michael?<br>

<p>RACH: Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me
the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . [jumps the couch and lands on Ross's back,
finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: You're over me?<br>
<br>
RACH: Ohhhhhhhh God. [climbs off his back]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?<br>

<br>
RACH: Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for

<br>
RACH: Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?<br>
<br>
RACH: Chandler told me.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?<br>
<br>
RACH: When you were in China.<br>
<br>
ROSS: China.<br>
<br>
RACH: Meeting Julie.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm

<br>
RACH: Are you over me?<br>
<br>
[A moment of silence.] <br>
<br>
ROSS: [doorbell buzzes] That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. [talks on intercom] Hi
Julie.<br>
<br>
JULIE: [over intercom] Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [perky] I'll be right down.<br>
<br>
RACH: Wait, so, you're going?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh,
y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.<br>
<br>
RACH: OK, OK.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Cat. [leaves]<br>
<br>
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Joey is watching a rabbi play an electric guitar on
TV. Phoebe enters.]<br>
<br>
PHOE: Hey Joey.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey Phoebs.<br>
<br>
PHOE: How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?<br>
<br>
JOEY: I can't find the remote. [Phoebe turns off the TV] Thank you.<br>
<br>
PHOE: So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.<br>
<br>
JOEY: And?<br>
<br>
PHOE: And we did.<br>
<br>
JOEY: All right Phoebs, way to go.<br>
<br>
PHOE: Yay me.<br>
<br>
JOEY: So, so how did it happen?<br>
<br>
PHOE: Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.<br>
<br>
JOEY: And what did he say?<br>
<br>
PHOE: He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a
woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna
call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la.
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Wow.<br>
<br>
PHOE: Yeah, so I said, &quot;OK, relax please,&quot; y'know, I mean, sex can be just about
two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can
call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he
never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.<br>
<br>
PHOE: Um-hum.<br>
<br>
JOEY: This man is my God.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is closing up and Ross comes in. Get your Kleenex.]<br>
<br>
RACH: Hi.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I didn't get a cat.<br>
<br>
RACH: Oh, that's um, interesting.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's
actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.<br>
<br>
RACH: Alright, I got it Ross.<br>
<br>
ROSS: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.<br>
<br>
RACH: [hurt] What?<br>
<br>
ROSS: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.<br>
<br>
RACH: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to
see you with Julie?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Then you should have said something before I met her.<br>
<br>
RACH: I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.<br>
<br>
ROSS: There was never a good time.<br>
<br>
RACH: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Not, not, not <b>every night</b>. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try,
Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or,
or Italian guys.<br>
<br>
RACH: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?<br>
<br>
ROSS: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with
somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.<br>
<br>
RACH: Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it
was you felt for me?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.<br>
<br>
RACH: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Fine.<br>
<br>
RACH: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Good.<br>
<br>
RACH: Good. [Ross leaves] </p>

<p>[Rachel gets up and opens the door, yelling after him.]</p>

<p align="left">RACH: And ya know what, now I've got closure.<br>
<br>
[Rachel slams the door and locks it. She sits down, visibly upset. She puts her head in
her hands and begins to cry. Ross comes back and is standing outside the window. When
Rachel regroups and gets back up to finish closing, she sees him. She smiles. She goes to
open the door and can't get the lock undone.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Try the bottom one.<br>

we're groovin'.<br>
<br>
CHAN: OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound.
OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.<br>
<br>
MNCA: Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?<br>
<br>
CHAN: Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.<br>
<br>
MNCA: Well, thanks.<br>
<br>
CHAN: I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.<br>
<br>
MNCA: Well, you know.<br>
<br>
CHAN: You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be
disappointed.<br>
<br>
MNCA: [sad] Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
CHAN: And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.<br>
<br>
MNCA: Well no, but um.<br>
<br>
CHAN: I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.<br>
<br>
MNCA: Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .<br>
<br>
CHAN: So, you feel like goin' for a run?<br>
<br>
MNCA: Alright.<br>
<br>
CHAN: Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right
here.<br>
<br>
MNCA: OK. Just for a little while.<br>
<br>
CHAN: OK. [Puts an afghan over her and dances into his room]</font></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel are there, discussing
the night before.]</p>

<p>RACH: Ross kissed me.</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!</p>

<p>RACH: It was unbelievable!</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!</p>

<p>PHOE: Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the
phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?</p>

<p>RACH: Oh, it ended very well.</p>

<p>PHOE: Oh.</p>

<p>MNCA: [getting the wine] Do not start without me. Do not start without me.</p>

<p>PHOE: Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush
against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a &quot;I gotta have you now&quot; kind of
thing?</p>

<p>RACH: Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we
just sort of sunk into it.</p>

<p>PHOE: Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?</p>

<p>RACH: No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then,
they were in my hair.</p>

<p>PHOE/MNCA: Ohhhh.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross' apartment. Ross, Chandler, and Joey are there eating pizza.]</p>

<p>ROSS: And, uh, and then I kissed her.</p>

<p>JOEY: Tongue?</p>

<p>ROSS: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOEY: Cool.</p>

<h3 align="center">Opening Credits</h3>

<p>[Scene: <i>Central Perk</i>. Joey, Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler are there; Chandler is
showing everyone his new computer.]</p>

<p>CHAN: All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive.
Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.</p>

<p>PHOE: Wow. What are you gonna use it for?</p>

<p>CHAN: [doggedly] Games and stuff.</p>

<p>MNCA: [reading the paper] There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.</p>

<p>JOEY: [reading over her shoulder] Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook
naked?</p>

<p>MNCA: There's an ad for a naked chef?</p>

<p>JOEY: No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance
naked. And then... [rubs his fingers together]</p>

<p>[Ross enters, distraught.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Hi.</p>

<p>PHOE: Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?</p>

<p>ROSS: That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just
painful</p>

<p>MNCA: Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.</p>

<p>ROSS: Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night
table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am,
I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me,
and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?</p>

<p>JOEY: You got all that from saline solution?</p>

<p>MNCA: We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.</p>

<p>ROSS: Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now,
I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... [Rachel
enters, carrying a tray]... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.</p>

<p>RACH: [to Ross] Hey, you.</p>

<p>ROSS: How are you?</p>

<p>RACH: Good. How are you?</p>

<p>ROSS: Good.</p>

<p>[Julie enters.]</p>

<p>JULIE: Hi, honey.</p>

<p>ROSS: Hi, Julie. [nervous] Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?</p>

<p>JULIE: Good.</p>

<p>ROSS: [uncomfortable] Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna
play something, Phoebe?</p>

<p>PHOE: Oh, well, actually.</p>

<p>ROSS: [impatient] Play it.</p>

<p>PHOE: Ok, all right.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.</p>

<p>JULIE: What?</p>

<p>ROSS: [to Joey] Ssshh.</p>

<p>PHOE: Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between
three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, &quot;Two of Them Kissed Last
Night&quot;. </p>

<p>[Ross and Rachel look at each other and then at Phoebe, realizing the song is about
their situation.]</p>

<p>PHOE: [singing] There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil.
Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must
decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves
truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide,
even though I made him up, he must decide!</p>

<p>[Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's (RTST) office. Monica is there about a job.]</p>

<p>RTST: This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. <i>Muy impressivo.</i></p>

<p>MNCA: So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.</p>

<p>RTST: Mockolate.</p>

<p>MNCA: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>RTST: Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.</p>

<p>MNCA: Ohh.</p>

<p>[He pulls out a piece of Mockolate.]</p>

<p>RTST: Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than
chocolate.</p>

<p>MNCA: All right. Mmm-mmm.</p>

<p>[She tastes it, and obviously hates it.]</p>

<p>RTST: Yeah?</p>

<p>MNCA: [disgusted, trying not to show it] I love how it crumbles. Now see, your
chocolate doesn't do that.</p>

<p>RTST: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now,
hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already
dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.</p>

<p>MNCA: [still chewing] Mmm-mmm.</p>

<p>RTST: But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the
Mockolate holiday.</p>

<p>MNCA: Wow.</p>

<p>RTST: Aren't you going to swallow that?</p>

<p>MNCA: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.</p>

<p>RTST: Yeah, isn't that great?</p>

<p>MNCA: [with false enthusiasm] Mmm.</p>

<p>RTST: Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some
Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?</p>

<p>MNCA: Abso...[swallows hard]...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love
Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.</p>

<p>RTST: Really?</p>

<p>MNCA: Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till
Christmas.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are there. Monica is
suggesting Mockolate recipes to Phoebe.]</p>

<p>MNCA: How about Mockolate mousse?</p>

<p>PHOE: It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.</p>

<p>MNCA: Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?</p>

<p>PHOE: What makes it pilgrim?</p>

<p>MNCA: We'll put buckles on it.</p>

<p>[Rachel enters.]</p>

<p>RACH: Hey.</p>

<p>PHOE: Hey.</p>

<p>MNCA: Hey.</p>

<p>RACH: Did uh, Ross call?</p>

<p>MNCA: No, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>RACH: Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with
her and she's going to be all, &quot;Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get
married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.&quot;</p>

<p>PHOE: No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Ross is up in arms about the Rachel/Julie
situation.]</p>

<p>ROSS: I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a
complete nightmare.</p>

<p>CHAN: Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both
gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too
tight.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]</p>

<p>CHAN: Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.</p>

<p>JOEY: Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.</p>

<p>[Ross gives him an insulted look.]</p>

<p>CHAN: Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel
and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I
can use different colors for each column.</p>

<p>ROSS: Can't we just use a pen?</p>

<p>CHAN: No, Amish boy.</p>

<p>JOEY: Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.</p>

<p>ROSS: I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled
sometimes.</p>

<p>JOEY: You could say that.</p>

<p>ROSS: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen
her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause
we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.</p>

<p>CHAN: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What
else?</p>

<p>ROSS: I don't know.</p>

<p>JOEY: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.</p>

<p>CHAN: Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?</p>

<p>ROSS: [long pause] She's not Rachel.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica has made food for Phoebe and Rachel to
taste.]</p>

<p>MNCA: Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate
cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.</p>

<p>[Rachel takes a bite.]</p>

<p>RACH: Oh my god.</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh my god good?</p>

<p>RACH: Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.</p>

<p>[Rachel runs to the sink to spit it out.]</p>

<p>PHOE: Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is on the phone with a computer
hotline.]</p>

<p>CHAN: I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100
times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background?
Are you watching Star Trek?</p>

<p>[Ross enters with a melancholy look.]</p>

<p>JOEY: [to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?</p>

<p>ROSS: Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway,
I did the right thing.</p>

<p>CHAN: [in phone] So, Spock actually hugs his father?</p>

<p>[Rachel enters.]</p>

<p>RACH: Hey, do you guys have...[sees Ross, pauses]...hi.</p>

<p>ROSS: Hi.</p>

<p>RACH: [sees his coat on] Where you goin'?</p>

<p>ROSS: I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.</p>

<p>RACH: [dejected] Oh.</p>

<p>ROSS: No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.</p>

<p>RACH: Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?</p>

<p>[Joey is looking at Rachel, smiling, and gesturing his head towards Ross.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Well, uh.</p>

<p>JOEY: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.</p>

<p>RACH: Really?</p>

<p>ROSS: Really. It's always been you, Rach.</p>

<p>[Ross and Rachel hug.]</p>

<p>RACH: Oh, god.</p>

<p>JOEY/CHAN: Ohhh.</p>

<p>RACH: Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.</p>

<p>ROSS: I know, I know, it's, it's almost...[turns around, sees Chandler and Joey] What
do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?</p>

<p>RACH: Let me get my coat.</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.</p>

<p>[Ross leaves.]</p>

<p>RACH: Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I
can't believe this. This is unbelievable. [notices Chandler's computer screen] What's
that?</p>

<p>CHAN: [nervous] What? Nothing.</p>

<p>[Chandler closes up the laptop computer screen.]</p>

<p>RACH: What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?</p>

<p>CHAN: No, no, see? See? [the printer starts to run] Hey, it's printing. [to Joey,
rattled] Hey, it's printing!</p>

<p>[Chandler rips off the sheet of paper from the printer.]</p>

<p>RACH: Well what is it? Let me see.</p>

<p>[Ross walks back in, Rachel's coat in hand.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Hey, someone order a coat?</p>

<p>RACH: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.</p>

<p>ROSS: He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the,
the short story you were writing?</p>

<p>CHAN: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.</p>

<p>RACH: And I'm in it? Then let me read it.</p>

<p>CHAN, JOEY, ROSS: No!</p>

<p>RACH: Come on.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?</p>

<p>[Ross and Chandler stare angrily at Joey, who thinks he has come up with a good idea.]</p>

<p>CHAN: [through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] &quot;It was summer, and it
was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the
kingdom was his forever. The end.&quot;</p>

<p>ROSS: That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.</p>

<p>RACH: All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on
that piece of paper and I want to see it.</p>

<p>ROSS: No, you don't.</p>

<p>RACH: All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about
this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. [Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the
room, reading it to herself.]</p>

<p>RACH: What is this? Ross, what is this?</p>

<p>CHAN: Good luck.</p>

<p>[Chandler and Joey leave quickly.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?</p>

<p>RACH: Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?</p>

<p>ROSS: Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type &quot;little&quot;, the
idiot.</p>

<p>RACH: Just a waitress?</p>

<p>ROSS: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?</p>

<p>RACH: Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!</p>

<p>[Rachel leaves, and Ross follows her into the hall.]</p>

<p>ROSS: No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.</p>

<p>RACH: She is not <i>Rachem</i>. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid
paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.</p>

<p>[She goes into her apartment and slams the door.]</p>

<p>ROSS: No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not,
Ra--Rachel?</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Central Perk</i>. Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe are there.]</p>

<p>CHAN: My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she
never would have made me read her my diary.</p>

<p>MNCA: You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an
emergency.</p>

<p>PHOE: I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.</p>

<p>PHOE: What?</p>

<p>MNCA: What?</p>

<p>CHAN: Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.</p>

<p>MNCA: This was your idea?</p>

<p>PHOE: What were you thinking?</p>

<p>CHAN: [squirming] All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they
happen for a reason.</p>

<p>MNCA: Yeah. You!</p>

<p>CHAN: All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't
you?</p>

<p>PHOE: Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting on the couch, eating candy. It
is raining out. Ross climbs up the fire escape and is knocking on the window.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!</p>

<p>RACH: [coldly] When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That
doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.</p>

<p>ROSS: I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.</p>

<p>RACH: Not interested.</p>

<p>[Rachel closes the drapes over the window, goes into her bedroom and closes the door.]</p>

<p>ROSS: [reading his list] Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two:
how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're
nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how
great you are with Ben. </p>

<p>[Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe enter, confused.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Number six: the way you smell.</p>

<p>JOEY: [opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?</p>

<p>ROSS: Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?</p>

<p>JOEY: Oh, yeah, I do.</p>

<p>[He opens the window, Ross comes in, soaked.]</p>

<p>CHAN: What are you doing out there?</p>

<p>ROSS: I am, uh, I am...</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup
of hot Mockolate?</p>

<p>[Ross runs to Rachel's bedroom, knocking on the door.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another
chance.</p>

<p>[Rachel opens the door.]</p>

<p>RACH: No.</p>

<p>ROSS: No?</p>

<p>RACH: That's what I said.</p>

<p>CHAN: Look, maybe we should go?</p>

<p>RACH: No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.</p>

<p>ROSS: Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.</p>

<p>RACH: [near tears] No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about
yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world
not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.</p>

<p>ROSS: No, but, but I wanna be with you in <b>spite</b> of all those things.</p>

<p>RACH: Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. [to the others] I said don't
go!</p>

<p>ROSS: You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's
nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.</p>

<p>RACH: Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.</p>

<p>[She closes the door in his face. Ross walks sullenly back to the couch and sits down.
A moment of silence ensues.]</p>

<p>JOEY: [quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a
situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little
longer.</p>

<p>[Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's office. Monica is there.]</p>

<p>MNCA: Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh,
like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and
four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.</p>

<p>RTST: Doesn't matter.</p>

<p>MNCA: What?</p>

<p>RTST: Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>RTST: Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. [hands it to her] Thank you for all the
trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking,
did you?</p>

<p>MNCA: Well, uh, I ate some.</p>

<p>RTST: Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when
you pee, does it?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Rachel are there.]</p>

<p>(phone rings)</p>

<p>MNCA: Hello?</p>

<p>[Ross is at his apartment.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Hi.</p>

<p>RACH: [to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are
weighin' me down.</p>

<p>MNCA: [to Ross] Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.</p>

<p>ROSS: Look, can, can you do something for me?</p>

<p>MNCA: Sure, what? Ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to Rachel] Music?</p>

<p>[Monica turns on the radio.]</p>

<p>RADIO: The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's
deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. (<i>With
or Without You </i>plays) </p>

<p>[Rachel seems touched. She pauses for a moment, then picks up the phone and starts to
dial. Cut to Ross at his apartment.]</p>

<p>RADIO: Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's
pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why
don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit
you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.</p>

<p>[Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's office. Monica is there.]</p>

<p>RTST: Hi, thanks for coming in again.</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.</p>

<p>RTST: It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called
&quot;fishtachios&quot;. They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of
reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?</p>

<p>MNCA: Cat hair.</p>

<p>RTST: Oh, sorry.</p>

<p align="left">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Rachel, Ross, and Phoebe
are there. Phoebe is looking out the window.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you
should see the size of his Christmas Balls.<br>
<br>
[Chandler and Joey enter.]<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hey.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look
bad.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: And twenty-five it is.<br>
<br>
JOEY: You gave him cookies?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're
broke, but cookies do say that.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.<br>
<br>
ROSS: So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uhh, the mailman, the super.<br>
<br>
[There's a bang at the door.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.<br>
<br>
[Joey opens the door and picks up the remnants of the newspaper.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh my God.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.<br>
<br>
[Joey shows them the torn-up newspaper.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is
bitemebitemebitemebiteme.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">OPENING TITLES</font><br>
<br>
[Scene: <i>Central Perk</i>. Monica, Chandler, and Joey are seated at couches. Rachel is
working behind the counter.]<br>
<br>
JOEY: I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey,
the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.<br>
<br>
[Ross enters with several bags from shopping.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hey guys.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER, MONICA, and JOEY: Hey.<br>
<br>
[Ross approaches Rachel at counter.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. [Rachel is not impressed]. . I'll open
it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. [sings] <i>Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs,
everyone knows it's</i>. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of
the whole. . .<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?<br>
<br>
ROSS: How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? [Rachel walks off]
Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?<br>
<br>
GUNTHER: Yeah.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Here, go nuts. [gives him the Slinky and goes and sits with others at the couches]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hey guys.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER, MONICA, and JOEY: Hey.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: What's in the bag?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Um, just some presents.<br>
<br>
JOEY: C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [childishly] OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Cute.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse
for mom.<br>
<br>
[Ross holds up the blouse. It is extremely tacky, with sewn-on medals hanging off of it.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Ross, that is gorgeous!<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed
at the make-believe military academy.<br>
<br>
[Phoebe enters.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Hey.<br>
<br>
GANG: Hey. Hi Phoebe.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get
this?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: How have you never been on Oprah?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture
before she died, same guy.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue
screen with a collie.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK,
I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, wait a minute honey.<br>
<br>
GANG: Phoebs. [Phoebe leaves]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Wow.<br>
<br>
JOEY: So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .<br>
<br>
GANG: Joey!<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!<br>
<br>
[Scene: Phoebe's grandmother's place. Phoebe's grandmother is sitting at the table,
reading the obituaries, and crossing out names in the phonebook.]<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Esther Livingston. [scratches out name] Gone.<br>
<br>
[Phoebe enters.]<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Hi, Phoe.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Oh, just updating the phonebook.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: [nervously] Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Just, you know, to see... um.<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Oh, sure, yeah. [gets a box with the pictures] This is the one of you father
in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . .
another graduation. . . another graduation.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, is this really my father?<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Look, I. . .<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you
have never lied to me.<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh God.<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real
father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it,
but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but
harder.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he
doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Honey.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: [realizes] Oh.<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. [pulls apart a frame and pulls a
picture out] This is the real him.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel, Chandler, and Joey are decorating the
Christmas tree.]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black
boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to
see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Who said anything about Christmas?<br>
<br>
[Monica and Ross enter.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Hi.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No, nothin'.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I hope she's OK.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.<br>
<br>
MONICA: How do you know exactly what she's going through?<br>
<br>
JOEY: She told us.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: So whaddya got there Monica?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Just some stuff for the party.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?<br>
<br>
MONICA: You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya
gonna do?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the
ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.<br>
<br>
[Ross approaches Rachel, away from everyone else.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better.
How 'bout you make a list about me.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .<br>
<br>
ROSS: C'mon Rachel.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're
gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You
like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much
of that gel in your hair.<br>
<br>
ROSS: See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she
walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]<br>
<br>
[Scene: Back at Phoebe's. She is on the phone]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica.
. . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself
information. [hangs up]<br>
<br>
[Phoebe's grandmother enters]<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Hey.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy
but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her
Gremlin.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I
didn't know exactly where he lived.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Whattaya mean?<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've
gone too far. You can take my cab.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Wow. Thank you.<br>
<br>
GRANDMOTHER: Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to
a picture of Einstein]<br>

<p>[Scene: Chandler is standing on a street corner waiting for Phoebe in the cab. Joey
walks up.]<br>
<br>
JOEY: Phoebe here with the cab yet?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.<br>

CHANDLER: Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll

PHOEBE: Hey.<br>

JOEY: Hey.<br>

PHOEBE: Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.<br>

JOEY: Yeah, big stuff.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, let's go.<br>

CHANDLER: OK.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: OK. [reads paper] Brake left, gas right?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: [grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
[Chandler jumps out of the car]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: [Chandler gets in the back seat] Hey!<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey. [Phoebe takes off, Joey and Chandler are thrown back in the seat]<br>

questioning her.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: C'mon, just tell me, please, please.<br>
<br>
MONICA: For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.<br>

[Rachel enters from her room]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross,
could you turn the heat down please?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .<br>
<br>
MONICA: Ross, the heat!<br>
<br>
ROSS: Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. [goes to the radiator and
starts turning the knob] OK, this way is on, so this is. . . [breaks off the knob] off.<br>

ROSS: Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: [on phone] Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, <i>somebody</i>,
uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough
to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday,
we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.<br>
<br>
ROSS: OK, tip the man.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look
if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Outside Phoebe's dad's house. The cab pulls up.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into the
plexiglass wall in the cab]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, so that's what this is for.<br>

stripped down because of the heat.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: [answers door] Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats
and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [sitting at table talking to a girl] It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I
use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that
be too much?<br>
<br>
MONICA: [carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.<br>

RACHEL: Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.<br>

JOEY: Phoebs, what's goin' on?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like,
yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now
he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me
and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really
nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, so why not go knock?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what
if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've
already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.<br>

PHOEBE: You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright

blank canvas.<br>

PHOEBE: Oh, I couldn't go in.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Honey, I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Are you OK?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for
now.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug,
Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope
that's alright.<br>

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey and Chandler are giving out their Christmas
presents out of a cardboard box from a case of motor oil.]<br>
<br>
JOEY: Rach, these are for you.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.<br>
<br>
JOEY: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: OK, Phoebs, your turn.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: You guuuyys.<br>
<br>
JOEY: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.<br>
<br>
ROSS: You got me a cola drink?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: And, a lemon lime.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: And last but not least.<br>

<p>[The gang is walking to a newsstand late at night. Joey is anxiously in the lead.]</p>

<p>RACH: Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock
in the morning.</p>

<p>JOEY: I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.</p>

<p>MNCA: You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.</p>

<p>PHOE: Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time.
Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.</p>

<p>JOEY: Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] <i>The only thing worse than the
mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of
the king.</i></p>

<p>CHAN: OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.</p>

<p>PHOE: OK. [reading] <i>The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...</i></p>

<p>CHAN: Does anyone have one from a <b>different</b> paper? Ross, read yours.</p>

<p>ROSS: I don't want to.</p>

<p>RACH: Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.</p>

<p>ROSS: Yeah.</p>

<p>JOEY: Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere.
There's gotta be a reason.</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.</p>

<p>JOEY: No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.</p>

<p>MNCA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe <b>this</b>
will change your mind. [Reads from paper] <i>In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able
to achieve brilliant new levels of...</i> continued on page 153...[turns it]<i> sucking.</i></p>

<h2 align="center">Credits</h2>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica comforting Joey at Monica and Rachel's
apartment.]</p>

<p>JOEY: When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to
put your hands into cows and stuff.</p>

<p>[Ross enters, depressed.]</p>

<p>ROSS: [sullenly] Hiiiiii.</p>

<p>PHOE: Are... are you OK?</p>

<p>ROSS: Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid.
Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He,
he's here, isn't he?</p>

<p>MNCA: Maybe.</p>

<p>ROSS: Don't toy with me.</p>

<p>[Fun Bobby (FBOB) enters from Monica's bedroom.]</p>

<p>FBOB: Geller!</p>

<p>ROSS: Hey, Fun Bobby!</p>

<p>FBOB: Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?</p>

<p>ROSS: Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my
sister!</p>

<p>MNCA: You and me both.</p>

<p>FBOB: Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?</p>

<p>PHOE: Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.</p>

<p>FBOB: Hey, do you need me to pick you up?</p>

<p>JOEY: No, I'm alright man. Really.</p>

<p>FBOB: No, I'm picking you up.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off
the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.</p>

<p>FBOB: OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? [everyone raises
their hands] I'm still gonna go.</p>

<p>MNCA: OK, I'll see you later babe.</p>

<p>FBOB: Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes. [kisses
Monica]</p>

<p>[Chandler and Joey are watching, Rachel turns their heads away from Monica.]</p>

<p>FBOB: See ya. [exits]</p>

<p>ALL: Bye! See you later!</p>

<p>PHOE: Fun Bobby is so great.</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I
mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of
months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.</p>

<p>PHOE: Half full of <b>looooovvvvve</b>.</p>

<p>MNCA: And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for
the weekend.</p>

<p>PHOE: Cabin of <b>loooooovvvvve</b>.</p>

<p>RACH: We went through a <b>lot</b> of wine tonight, you guys. [walks over to table,
holding five empty wine bottles]</p>

<p>MNCA: Really? I only had two glasses.</p>

<p>JOEY: I just had a glass.</p>

<p>PHOE: Two.</p>

<p>RACH: I had one glass.</p>

<p>CHAN: I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural
History' mug.</p>

<p>RACH: OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?</p>

<p>[All look towards door Fun Bobby left through.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Oooooh.</p>

<p>JOEY: [realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.</p>

<p>MNCA: So what. So he drank a lot tonight.</p>

<p>ROSS: Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun
Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.</p>

<p>PHOE: Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories
with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh,
'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'</p>

<p>JOEY: Monica, have you ever been with him when he <b>wasn't</b> drinking?</p>

<p>MNCA: Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how
do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica, Fun Bobby, and Phoebe sitting in <i>Central Perk</i> Rachel is serving
them. She brings a mug to Monica.]</p>

<p>MNCA: Rach, does this have nonfat milk?</p>

<p>RACH: Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.</p>

<p>MNCA: [takes a sip] Mmmm, no.</p>

<p>RACH: Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.</p>

<p>FBOB: [pulls out a flask] Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?</p>

<p>[Phoebe and Rachel look uncomfortable.]</p>

<p>PHOE: Um, cake.</p>

<p>RACH: Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to
counter.]</p>

<p>MNCA: You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish
lately.</p>

<p>FBOB: Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.</p>

<p>MNCA: Bobby.</p>

<p>FBOB: Yeah, OK.</p>

<p>MNCA: Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh,
I'm kind of worried about you.</p>

<p>FBOB: OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this,
but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social
drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'</p>

<p>MNCA: So, what are you saying now?</p>

<p>FBOB: I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
[they hug]</p>

<p>PHOE: [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?</p>

<p>FBOB: I am gonna try and quit drinking.</p>

<p>PHOE: [sad] Ooohh, why?</p>

<p>[Chandler and Joey enter.]</p>

<p>CHAN: Hey.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey.</p>

<p>MNCA: Hey.</p>

<p>PHOE: Hey.</p>

<p>CHAN: Guess who's back in show business.</p>

<p>PHOE: Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?</p>

<p>CHAN: No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.</p>

<p>PHOE: Oh, no.</p>

<p>CHAN: OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for <i>Days of Our Lives</i>!</p>

<p>PHOE: Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a
soap opera theme.</p>

<p>CHAN: Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.</p>

<p>PHOE: Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.</p>

<p>RACH: Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.</p>

<p>MNCA: [gasps] You have other friends?</p>

<p>RACH: Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.</p>

<p>MNCA: What?</p>

<p>JOEY: With a man?</p>

<p>RACH: What? What is so strange about me having a date?</p>

<p>JOEY: What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about
you?</p>

<p>RACH: Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really <b>anything</b> at him
anymore.</p>

<p>MNCA: What are you talking about?</p>

<p>RACH: I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.</p>

<p>PHOE: But you guys came so close.</p>

<p>RACH: Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact
that I will not be dating Ross.</p>

<p>[Russ enters <i>Central Perk</i>. He looks like Ross, except for his chin and hair (it
is David Schwimmer in a dual role).]</p>

<p>RACH: Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.</p>

<p>RUSS: [sounding like Ross] Hhhhiiiii.</p>

<p>[Everyone looks at each other in amazement.]</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Estelle Leonard Talent Agency</i>. Estelle (ESTL) is speaking on the phone.]</p>

<p>ESTL: Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird
dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? [a knock
on the door] Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.</p>

<p>[Joey enters.]</p>

<p>ESTL: Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?</p>

<p>JOEY: Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.</p>

<p>ESTL: Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?</p>

<p>JOEY: No.</p>

<p>ESTL: Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]</p>

<p>JOEY: OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network
casting lady...</p>

<p>ESTL: Oh, isn't Lori a doll?</p>

<p>JOEY: Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort
of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if
I would have sent the Little General in.</p>

<p>ESTL: Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's
goin' on and straighten it out. [picks up the phone] Yeah, hi, Lori please. [pause] Hi
darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific?
[pause] Uh-huuuuh. [pause] Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. [hangs up] [to Joey]
Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Central Perk</i>. Monica and Rachel at counter, Phoebe, Chandler, and Fun
Bobby at the couch.]</p>

<p>RACH: What's the matter?</p>

<p>MNCA: It's Fun Bobby.</p>

<p>RACH: What, isn't he sober?</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.</p>

<p>RACH: Ohhh, OK.</p>

<p>[Monica returns to couch next to Fun Bobby.]</p>

<p>MNCA: Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]</p>

<p>FBOB: Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh God, yes!</p>

<p>FBOB: There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.</p>

<p>PHOE: That <b>is</b> funny.</p>

<p>FBOB: I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the
neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the
Village.</p>

<p>MNCA: Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?</p>

<p>FBOB: Oh yeah. See you guys. [leaves]</p>

<p>CHAN: Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh.... my... God.</p>

<p>PHOE: It's not that bad.</p>

<p>MNCA: Not that bad? Did you <b>hear</b> the hammer story?</p>

<p>PHOE: OK, OK, don't get all squinky.</p>

<p>RACH: Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.</p>

<p>MNCA: But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with
him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.</p>

<p>PHOE: Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set
it free.</p>

<p>[Russ enters, walking in behind Chandler.]</p>

<p>RUSS: Hi.</p>

<p>CHAN: [turning around] Hey Ross.... bahhhh!</p>

<p>RACH: Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?</p>

<p>RUSS: OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.</p>

<p>[Phoebe walks up to Rachel, cleaning tables.]</p>

<p>PHOE: Rachel? Um, hi.</p>

<p>RACH: Hi.</p>

<p>PHOE: OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?</p>

<p>RACH: Uhh.... waitressing?</p>

<p>PHOE: Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of
someone?</p>

<p>RACH: [looks at him] Huh, Bob Saget?</p>

<p>PHOE: [looks at Russ] Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.</p>

<p>[Phoebe turns back around but Rachel is gone. Ross enters.]</p>

<p>PHOE: Oh, my, oh!</p>

<p>ROSS: What? What's wrong?</p>

<p>PHOE: I, OK....</p>

<p>MNCA: She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this
morning.</p>

<p>ROSS: Alright.</p>

<p>CHAN: [to Phoebe] Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. [introducing Russ and Ross]
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.</p>

<p>RUSS: Hi.</p>

<p>ROSS: Hi.</p>

<p>RUSS: Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?</p>

<p>ROSS: Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?</p>

<p>RUSS: Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of
Rachel's.</p>

<p>ROSS: A date.</p>

<p>RUSS: Yeah, I'm her date.</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh <b>you're</b> the date.</p>

<p>CHAN: You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.</p>

<p>RUSS: Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.</p>

<p>ROSS: Yes, yes I am. And you are a....</p>

<p>RUSS: Periodontist.</p>

<p>MNCA: See? They're as different as night and... later that night.</p>

<p>ROSS: Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting
you.</p>

<p>RUSS: Ditto.</p>

<p>[ROss approaches Rachel at counter.]</p>

<p>ROSS: I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.</p>

<p>RACH: Oh.</p>

<p>ROSS: Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.</p>

<p>RACH: Well, we're not seeing each other, so....</p>

<p>ROSS: Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of
moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to
me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if
this is the deal...</p>

<p>RACH: Well, yeah, this is the deal.</p>

<p>ROSS: OK, well, um, have a nice evening.</p>

<p>RACH: Um, Russ, you ready?</p>

<p>RUSS: Yeah.</p>

<p>RACH: Bye.</p>

<p>MNCA: Bye.</p>

<p>PHOE: Bye.</p>

<p>[Russ and Rachel leave together.]</p>

<p>ROSS: [upset] She's dating. <b>She's dating.</b></p>

<p>CHAN: Yes, yes, but did you see <b>who</b> she was dating?</p>

<p>ROSS: What do you mean?</p>

<p>MNCA: Do you not see it?</p>

<p>ROSS: See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him,
what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a
sentence.</p>

<p>CHAN: Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?</p>

<p>ROSS: ....................Yeah.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Joey is making marinara sauce and filling every
container in sight. Chandler enters.]</p>

<p>CHAN: Hey.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey.</p>

<p>CHAN: Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and
said it was hungry.</p>

<p>JOEY: Well, the part's mine if I want it.</p>

<p>CHAN: Oh my God!</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.</p>

<p>CHAN: [not knowing how to react] Oh my... God?</p>

<p>JOEY: Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, <i>Days
of Our Lives</i>. That's actually on television.</p>

<p>CHAN: So, what're you gonna do?</p>

<p>JOEY: Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?</p>

<p>CHAN: Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.</p>

<p>JOEY: I've never slept with someone for a part.</p>

<p>CHAN: Well is she... [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out,
covered with pasta sauce]</p>

<p>JOEY: Sorry.</p>

<p>CHAN: It's alright. Is she good-looking?</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something,
I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.</p>

<p>CHAN: Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it
is you get a great job <b>and</b> you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and
a fat guy and you've got Christmas.</p>

<p>JOEY: I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean,
let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because
of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.</p>

<p>CHAN: Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.</p>

<p>[Scene: A restaurant. Fun Bobby and Monica are ordering.]</p>

<p>WAITER: Can I get you something from the bar?</p>

<p>MNCA: Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank
you.</p>

<p>FBOB: If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.</p>

<p>MNCA: No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water.</p>

<p>FBOB: So the light went out in my refrigerator...</p>

<p>MNCA: [grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Central Perk</i>. Chandler is sitting on the couch between Russ and Ross,
doing a crossword puzzle.]</p>

<p>CHAN: Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK...
eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in <i>ium</i>.</p>

<p>RUSS: Dysprosium.</p>

<p>ROSS: [condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.</p>

<p>CHAN: And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, <i>Knights in White
Satin</i> was sung by the Doody Blues.</p>

<p>[Phoebe and Rachel are at the counter talking.]</p>

<p>PHOE: You don't see it? You actually don't see it?</p>

<p>RACH: What?</p>

<p>PHOE: OK honey, you're dating Ross.</p>

<p>RACH: No, Phoebs. I'm dating <b>Russ</b>.</p>

<p>PHOE: Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!</p>

<p>RACH: Steve... sleeve!</p>

<p>PHOE: OK, noone is named Sleeve.</p>

<p>RACH: Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being
similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.</p>

<p>[They look over at Russ and Ross.]</p>

<p>ROSS: [to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.</p>

<p>RUSS: You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.</p>

<p>CHAN: OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.</p>

<p>RUSS: I know what your problem is.</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh you do, do you?</p>

<p>RUSS: Um-hum, you're jealous.</p>

<p>ROSS: Of... of what?</p>

<p>RUSS: You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.</p>

<p>ROSS: Hey, you're a doctor of <b>gums</b>. That's the smallest body part you can major
in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.</p>

<p>RUSS: Hey, you listen.</p>

<p>ROSS: No, no, let me finish.</p>

<p>RUSS: No, let me finish.</p>

<p>ROSS: No, you let me fini...</p>

<p>[Rachel walks up behind them.]</p>

<p>ROSS: Hi.</p>

<p>RUSS: Hi.</p>

<p>RACH: Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! [turns away]</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross, Phoebe, Rachel, and Chandler at Monica and Rachel's apartment.]</p>

<p>RACH: Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?</p>

<p>CHAN: No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great
job?</p>

<p>RACH: I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?</p>

<p>CHAN: Me.</p>

<p>RACH: Why would I have to sleep with you?</p>

<p>CHAN: It's my game. You want the job or not?</p>

<p>[Monica enters from her bedroom.]</p>

<p>CHAN: Hey.</p>

<p>MNCA: Morning.</p>

<p>ROSS: Where ya goin'?</p>

<p>MNCA: Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?</p>

<p>ROSS: Ooooohhhh.</p>

<p>[Monica pulls out a bag full of airline bottles of liquor.]</p>

<p>PHOE: What's with all the bottles of liquor?</p>

<p>ROSS: What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I
find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.</p>

<p>[Three slow knocks on the door.]</p>

<p>RACH: Oh God, even his knock is boring.</p>

<p>[Monica answers the door. Its Fun Bobby.]</p>

<p>MNCA: Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.</p>

<p>FBOB: Uh, can I talk to you a minute?</p>

<p>MNCA: Sure.</p>

<p>[They both step out into the hall.]</p>

<p>FBOB: This is really hard for me to say.</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh God, you fell off the wagon.</p>

<p>FBOB: Oh, no, no, it's about you.</p>

<p>MNCA: What about me?</p>

<p>FBOB: I think you may have a drinking problem.</p>

<p>MNCA: What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and
scrapes.</p>

<p>FBOB: Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now,
OK?</p>

<p>MNCA: Oh... shoot.</p>

<p>FBOB: Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.</p>

<p>MNCA: OK.</p>

<p>[They hug and kiss.]</p>

<p>MNCA: Take care.</p>

<p>FBOB: You too.</p>

<p>[Fun Bobby leaves and Monica goes back inside.]</p>

<p>RACH: What happened?</p>

<p>MNCA: Well we... we kinda broke up.</p>

<p>GANG: Awwwwwwww.</p>

<p>[Ross, Phoebe, Chandler, and Rachel all exchange money.]</p>

<p>MNCA: [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?</p>

<p>CHAN: I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.</p>

<p>[Joey enters.]</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey.</p>

<p>GANG: Hey!</p>

<p>ROSS: How'd the callback go?</p>

<p>JOEY: It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.</p>

<p>CHAN: So what'd you do?</p>

<p>JOEY: Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.</p>

<p>ROSS: Good for you.</p>

<p>JOEY: But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the
elevator and offered me an even bigger part.</p>

<p>PHOE: So... and?</p>

<p>JOEY: Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at
least four episodes!</p>

<p>GANG: Allright!</p>

<p>JOEY: Alright... I've got to go shower. [leaves]</p>

<p>[Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Chandler exchange money again.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>Credits</b> [Scene: <i>Central Perk</i>. Russ enters. Chandler and
Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]</p>

<p>RUSS: Hi.</p>

<p>CHAN: Oh, hey.</p>

<p>PHOE: Hi.</p>

<p>RUSS: I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.</p>

<p>CHAN: Yeah, I'm sorry man.</p>

<p>RUSS: Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea
who she's talking about?</p>

<p>[Chandler and Phoebe feign ignorance.]</p>

<p>PHOE: Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.</p>

<p>RUSS: Oh.</p>

<p>[Julie... Ross's ex-girlfriend... enters.]</p>

<p>JULIE: Hey.</p>

<p>CHAN: Hey!</p>

<p>PHOE: Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?</p>

<p>JULIE: Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I
guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....</p>

<p>[Russ and Julie look at each other with love in their eyes. The music builds...]</p>

<p><i>[at Ross's. Carol and Susan are picking Ben up]</i></p>

<p>ROSS: Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!</p>

<p>CAROL: So how did everything go?</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he
started it.</p>

<p>CAROL: Well, we've gotta go.</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok.</p>

<p>SUSAN: <i>[clears her throat]</i></p>

<p>CAROL: Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh, you and me?</p>

<p>CAROL: Uh, no, Susan and me.</p>

<p>SUSAN: The other us.</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok.</p>

<p>CAROL: We're uh, we're getting married.</p>

<p>ROSS: As in, &quot;I now pronounce you wife and wife&quot; married?</p>

<p>CAROL: Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.</p>

<p>ROSS: Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.</p>

<p>CAROL: Look I just thought that...</p>

<p>ROSS: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about
me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!</p>

<p>SUSAN: Is your finger caught in that chair?</p>

<p>ROSS: Mmm hmmm.</p>

<p>CAROL: Want us to go?</p>

<p>ROSS: Uh-huh.</p>

<p><i>[at Rachel and Monica's]</i></p>

<p>ROSS: This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.</p>

<p>JOEY: It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I
started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..</p>

<p>MONICA: Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and
she's in a full body cast.</p>

<p>ROSS, CHANDLER &amp; JOEY: Yes!</p>

<p>MONICA: They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered
before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?</p>

<p>ROSS: Would it matter?</p>

<p>MONICA: Oh, you are so great! <i>[kisses him]</i> Thank you!</p>

<p>JOEY: Are you really not going?</p>

<p>ROSS: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they
need to get married?</p>

<p>MONICA: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that
are close with them.</p>

<p>ROSS: If you wanna call that a reason.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: <i>[singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]</i> Who's the
bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.</p>

<p>MONICA: Ross, I thought you were over this.</p>

<p>ROSS: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were
marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.</p>

<p>RACHEL: <i>[entering hurriedly]</i> Did I miss it? Did I miss it?</p>

<p>JOEY: No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Whoa, she's pretty.</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras,
and smell-the-fart acting.</p>

<p>RACHEL: I'm sorry, what?</p>

<p>MONICA: What?</p>

<p>JOEY: It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a
minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause
where you look all intense, you know, like this. </p>

<p>CHANDLER: Oh, ok.</p>

<p>JOEY: There's my scene, there's my scene. <i>[Joey on tv]</i> &quot;Mrs. Wallace, I'm
Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. </p>

<p>MRS. WALLACE: Is she gonna be all right?</p>

<p>JOEY: I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering
from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Nice!</p>

<p>RACHEL: That's great!</p>

<p>ROSS: Excellent!</p>

<p>CHANDLER: For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.</p>

<p><i>[Monica and Rachel's]</i></p>

<p>ROSS: That is so good! Do it again!</p>

<p>JOEY: All right, all right. &quot;Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the
chart!&quot;</p>

<p>CHANDLER: That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to
inspect.</p>

<p>ROSS: No no, that's me.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Oh, yeah. </p>

<p>ROSS: Oh, hello.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...</p>

<p>ROSS: Is everything ok?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh my god.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.</p>

<p>MONICA: Oh, honey.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought,
&quot;ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have
my massage.&quot; Little did she know God was thinking, &quot;Ok, but that's it.&quot; Oh,
but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the
spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.</p>

<p>RACHEL: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I think it went into me.</p>

<p><i>[Everyone takes a step back from Phoebe]</i></p>

<p><i>[Central Perk]</i></p>

<p>MONICA: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called
Silence of the Ducks.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ok, who ordered what?</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh god.</p>

<p>JOEY: I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.</p>

<p>RACHEL: I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think
that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: <i>[Mrs. Adelman's voice]</i> Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman
tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.</p>

<p>JOEY: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. <i>[Mrs.
Adelman's voice]</i> Sit up!</p>

<p>MRS. GREEN: <i>[entering]</i> There she is.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Mom!</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Pretty much.</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.</p>

<p>RACHEL: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: Oh hello, Ross. </p>

<p>ROSS: Hi, Mrs. Green. <i>[He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]</i></p>

<p>MRS GREEN: So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh Mom!</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Believe me, sometimes that happens.</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my
father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Really?</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: Yes.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she
got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.</p>

<p>JOEY: Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?</p>

<p><i>[at Rachel and Monica's</i></p>

<p>MRS GREEN: Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: <i>[laughing]</i> You have some life here, sweetie.</p>

<p>RACHEL: I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry
and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is
just so much better for me, you know?</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at
you and I think, oh, this is what I want.</p>

<p>RACHEL: For...me.</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: Well, not just for you.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Well, what do you mean?</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: I'm uh, considering leaving your father.</p>

<p>MONICA: <i>[entering]</i> All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding,
chicken breasts.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.</p>

<p>MONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.</p>

<p>ROSS: And you had no idea they weren't getting along?</p>

<p>RACHEL: None.</p>

<p>JOEY: They didn't fight a lot?</p>

<p>RACHEL: No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they
were having problems?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: <i>[Mrs. Adelman's voice]</i> In my day, divorce was not an option.</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey, look who's up.</p>

<p>RACHEL: I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's
parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about
this.</p>

<p>MONICA: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's
doing it because she wants to be more like you.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this
shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your
case it's actually kinda true.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: That's him.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.</p>

<p>MR A: Phoebe?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.</p>

<p>MR A: Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Um, do you wanna sit?</p>

<p>MR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can
I do for you, my dear?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her
body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.</p>

<p>MR A: You're saying, my wife is in you?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished
business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?</p>

<p>MR A: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that
she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Everything?</p>

<p>MR A: Everything.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>MR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.</p>

<p>MR A: <i>[to Joey]</i> Worth a shot, huh?</p>

<p><i>[Joey nods and shrugs.]</i></p>

<p>MRS GREEN: Look at this.</p>

<p>RACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago.</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?</p>

<p>RACHEL: No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a
regular dentist.</p>

<p>MONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, &quot;thank you, but I don't really
need your help&quot;?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Actually, what I think you said was, &quot;don't touch that, and get the hell
out of my kitchen.&quot;</p>

<p>MONICA: Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I
planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually
do it.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?</p>

<p>MONICA: If you want.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: <i>[enters]</i> Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern
Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>RACHEL: She's still with you?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go
to the bathroom again. <i>[Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's
voice]</i> Oh, such a pretty face.</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does
anybody have any marijuana?</p>

<p>RACHEL: God!</p>

<p>MONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. </p>

<p>MRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex?</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father.</p>

<p>MONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there
might be more.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean,
god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What?
What do you want? Do you want my blessing?</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: No.</p>

<p>RACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it?</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: No.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Then what? What do you want?</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this?</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh.</p>

<p>MONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes
left. Move, move, move!</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.</p>

<p>MONICA: Joey, speed it up!</p>

<p>JOEY: I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.</p>

<p>MONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Sir! No sir!</p>

<p>MONICA: <i>[to Ross]</i> All right, you!</p>

<p>ROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.</p>

<p>MONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and
I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those
little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called &quot;pigs in Ross&quot;. All
right, ball the melon.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.</p>

<p><i>[knock at the door]</i></p>

<p>MONICA: Hi.</p>

<p>CAROL: How's it going?</p>

<p>MONICA: It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.<i>[everyone
groans]</i></p>

<p>CAROL: Fine, whatever.</p>

<p>ROSS: What's the matter?</p>

<p>CAROL: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.</p>

<p>ROSS: What?</p>

<p>MONICA: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.</p>

<p>ROSS: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?</p>

<p>CAROL: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh my god.</p>

<p>CAROL: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my
parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.</p>

<p>ROSS: It's ok. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CAROL: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call
off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and
if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to
do.</p>

<p>ROSS: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.</p>

<p>CAROL: You do?</p>

<p>ROSS: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.</p>

<p>CAROL: Of course I do.</p>

<p>ROSS: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell
with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped
me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.</p>

<p>CAROL: You're right. Of course you're right.</p>

<p>MONICA: So we're back on?</p>

<p>CAROL: We're back on.</p>

<p>MONICA: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.</p>

<p><i>[at the wedding]</i></p>

<p>JOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like
Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my
lesbian wedding.</p>

<p><i>[Wedding music starts, Phoebe noisily unwraps a piece of candy.]</i></p>

<p>PHOEBE: <i>[Mrs. Adelman's voice]</i> Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry
later.</p>

<p><i>[Monica pushes Ben down the aisle in a stroller. Susan is escorted by both her
parents. Carol is escorted by Ross.]</i></p>

<p>CAROL: Thank you.</p>

<p>ROSS: Any time. <i>[He doesn't want to let her go]</i></p>

<p>CAROL: Ross. <i>[He lets her go]</i></p>

<p>MINISTER: You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people,
come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan
in holy matrimony.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: <i>[Mrs. Adelman's voice]</i> Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! <i>[Phoebe's
voice]</i> Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.</p>

<p><i>[At the reception, Monica and Ross watch Carol and Susan getting their picture
taken.]</i></p>

<p>MONICA: Would you look at them?</p>

<p>ROSS: Yeah, can't help but.</p>

<p>JOEY: <i>[to a wedding guest]</i> How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? <i>[the

<p>PHOEBE: I miss Rose. </p>

<p>CHANDLER: Oh, yeah? </p>

<p>PHOEBE: I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you
know, and now I just feel kind of alone.</p>

<p>WOMAN: You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think
it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a
drink?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Ok, that's so nice.</p>

<p><i>[Chandler tries to warn Phoebe that the woman is coming on to her, but Phoebe
doesn't see him.]</i></p>

<p>CHANDLER: <i>[to an attractive woman]</i> I shouldn't even bother coming up with a
line, right? <i>[The woman walks away]</i></p>

<p>RACHEL: Hey, Mom? Having fun?</p>

<p>MRS GREEN: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other
girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue,
but it's nice to know I have options.</p>

<p>RACHEL: There's more alcohol, right?</p>

<p><i>[Susan approaches Ross, who's looking lonely]</i></p>

<p>SUSAN: How you doin'?</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok.</p>

<p>SUSAN: You did a good thing today.</p>

<p>ROSS: Yeah.</p>

<p>SUSAN: You wanna dance?</p>

<p>ROSS: No, that's fine.</p>

<p>SUSAN: Come on. I'll let you lead.</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok.</p>

<p><i>[They dance; Carol looks on lovingly.]</i></p>

<p>CHANDLER: <i>[to the woman who just rejected him]</i> All right look. Penis schmenis.
We're all people. <i>[She walks away again.]</i></p>

<p><i>[at Monica and Rachel's]</i></p>

<p>MONICA: Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?</p>

<p>ROSS: Well, Mon, I was married.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yeah, me, too, technically.</p>

<p>RACHEL: I had a wedding.</p>

<p>MONICA: All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.</p>

<p>JOEY: I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? <i>[They
all look at Chandler]</i></p>

<p>CHANDLER: Isn't Ben in this?</p>

<br>
<a name="line25"></a> ROSS: Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message?
Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK,
bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, some guy she met at the movies.<br>
<br>
<a name="line12"></a> ROSS: Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?<br>

CHANDLER: Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little
love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [puts the message in the cupboard] I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I

takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be
takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we
should get some kind of me, message service.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Hang in there, it's gonna happen.<br>
<br>
<a name="line13"></a> ROSS: Wha, OK, now how do you know that?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Because she's your lobster.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, she's goin' somewhere.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.
You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya
know, holding claws like. . .<br>

[Monica enters from bathroom after taking a shower]<br>
<br>
<a name="line02"></a> CHANDLER: Hey, you feelin' better?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.<br>
<br>
<a name="line03"></a> PHOEBE: So, do you have any other possibilities?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense
every time I saw you.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You
feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ya know, the man's got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls
off]<br>
<br>
<a name="line04"></a> PHOEBE: What is that sparkly thing?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.<br>

<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica answers the door and lets her parents in.
They are carrying boxes.]</b><br>
<br>
MONICA: Hi.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Hi.<br>

MRS. GELLER: Hi darling.<br>
<br>
MONICA: So, what's this.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Some of your old stuff.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and
plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, God forbid.<br>
<br>
[Rachel enters with a laundry basket]<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Oh, hi Rachel.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hi.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy
ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What, what incident?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't
you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold. [shuffles her into her room]<br>

CHANDLER: No, I'm alright, thanks.<br>

just right. [she sticks out her gut, clears her throat and sniffs her nose and then in her
best male voice. . .] Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really
good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: [walks over to the woman] I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of
Wendy's.<br>
<br>
GAIL: I'm Gail.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Chandler. [waves his arm around, exposing the bracelet]<br>
<br>
GAIL: I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.<br>
<br>
<a name="line14"></a> CHANDLER: What? [realizes it was the bracelet] Oh this is excellent.
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he
has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: It's not that bad.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some
reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Chandler, Chandler.<br>
<br>
<a name="line15"></a> CHANDLER: I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity
the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh,
impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. [Joey turns around and walks out without
saying anything] That's actually good.<br>

ROSS: Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like,
back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I think she's OK.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [Rachel, laughing, puts a hand on the guy's shoulder] Look at that, look at that,
see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. [walks
up in the middle of their conversation] Excuse me, are you Rachel?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What?<br>
<br>
ROSS: I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What are you, what are you doin'?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if
it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.<br>

MAN: Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.<br>

<br>
RACHEL: Ross, there is no us, OK.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, but. . .<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I
again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not
worth it.<br>

ROSS: Well, but, but. . .<br>

doesn't move to catch it and the ball takes out a lamp] OK, that's my bad.<br>
<br>
JOEY: If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say
something about our friendship and how much it means to me?<br>
<br>
<a name="line17"></a> JOEY: Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and
you made fun of me?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on
that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a
hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . [notices the bracelet is missing
from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just
uh, you stay in there. [he starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]<br>
<br>
JOEY: You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]<br>
<br>
<a name="line18"></a> CHANDLER: I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as
a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may
haveth anger now. . . [Joey returns to his room]<br>

ROSS: C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.<br>

MONICA and ROSS: In the bank.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's
gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. [pulls a quarter

in the hay.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just
dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.

DR. BURKE: No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm
OK' head bob. [demonstrates] 'I'm OK.' [tilts head] 'You sure?' [bobs head] 'Yeah, I'm

him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just
it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: It's OK, it's fine.<br>

ROSS: KARL!<br>

models.]<br>

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Dr. Burke are sitting on the couch. He's
showing her the pictures in his wallet.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Wow, is that Michelle?<br>

DR. BURKE: Yep.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so
dru. . . motional.<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: Ya know, she's having another baby.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I thought she just had one.<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the
other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his
other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, you're a grandpa.<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: Yeah. Are we nuts here?<br>
<br>
MONICA: I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a
whole person who can drink older than you.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yeah.<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: So.<br>
<br>
MONICA: So maybe we should just. . .<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: Yeah, yeah, maybe.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Wow, this really sucks.<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: Yeah, it sure does. [they hug and it turns into a passionate kiss]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: No, no, there's no rush or anything.<br>
<br>
[knock at the door]<br>
<br>
DELIVERY GUY: Pizza delivery.<br>

MONICA: Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.<br>

<br>
[Scene: The museum planetarium. Ross and Rachel enter on stage.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What is this? What are we doing?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Grape.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [spreads the pelt on the floor] OK, now, sit. OK. [he starts the music system]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, God.<br>
<br>
[The stereo system booms out 'Billions of years ago. . .'. Ross gets up and changes it to
music.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Sorry.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ah, so what are we looking at?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is
Ursa Major.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Really?<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="left">ROSS: I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. [they kiss]<br>
<br>
ROSS: You're not laughing.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: This time it's not so funny.<br>
<br>
[They kiss and start undressing. As Rachel tries to pull off Ross's tie she catches it in
his mouth. Then they roll across the fur rug.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.<br>
<br>
ROSS: What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, thank God.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Museum of Natural History. The next morning Rachel and Ross are sleeping in the
display under a fur.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hi.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.<br>

at the bar, in their bathrobes, eating cereal]</b><br>
<br>
JOEY: Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his
hat?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a <b>cereal</b> for the
last 40 years.<br>
<br>
[Joey finishes his cereal, licks his spoon, and puts it back in the silverware drawer.]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Waaa-aaah.<br>
<br>
JOEY: What?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, so.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my
toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the
first thing you wash.<br>

CHANDLER: Hey.<br>
<br>
MONICA and PHOEBE: Hey.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ahh.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: [enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Okey-doke.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?<br>
<br>
JOEY: So where you gettin' it?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]<br>
<br>
ROSS: What? What's on your shoulder?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.<br>
<br>
ROSS: A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?
What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair
cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No, I think you should tell them.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them
anything.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and
Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: The Gellers' house. Monica, Ross, and Richard are arriving to Mr. Gellers
birthday party.]</b><br>
<br>
ROSS: Alright, shall we?<br>
<br>
MONICA: OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You
get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something
up.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
[opens door] We're here.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Oh hi kids. Hi darling.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Happy birthday dad.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Oh thank you.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hi ma.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Happy birthday.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.<br>

preparing the cake.]</b><br>
<br>
FRIEND: Well, you kids take the train in?<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.<br>
<br>
FRIEND: Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
[Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Are we still on that?<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.<br>
<br>
FRIEND: She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still
pointing up. [Monica folds her arms over her breasts]<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Joey's co-star's apartment. Chandler and Joey are at the brunch.]</b><br>
<br>
JOEY: Can you believe this place?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I know, this is a great apartment.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when
you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.<br>
<br>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Hey.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.<br>
<br>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Thanks. You want it?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Huh?<br>
<br>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?<br>
<br>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the
kitchen.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: [being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning -
on TV. Stop talking. OK.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Mr. Geller's party. Mr. Geller and a friend are questioning Richard while Ross
observes.]</b><br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: C'mon, tell us.<br>
<br>
FRIEND: Yeah, is she really 20.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: I am not telling you guys anything.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Dad, you really don't want to do that.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Jack, would you let it go?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche.
You... you got your own little speedster.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Guys. Seriously, it is <b>not</b> like that.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. .
.<br>

ROSS: Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.<br>

MR. GELLER: What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.<br>

<br>
PHOEBE: OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well I. . .<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more
open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.<br>
<br>
TATTOO ARTIST: Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with
me.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Here we go.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: [reluctantly] Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: You're not going?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No. Well, yeah, maybe.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals
boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What's 1922?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a
lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you
want to get this tattoo?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, who is the boss of you?!!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: You?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart
tattooed on your hip. <b>GO</b>!!<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica is in the bathroom and Richard comes in.]</b><br>
<br>
RICHARD: How ya doin'?<br>
<br>
MONICA: I'm a twinkie.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Really? I'm a hero.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, this is so hard.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: My parents are dead.<br>
<br>
MONICA: God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Alright.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: [walks out of the bathroom and runs into Mrs. Geller who is going to the
bathroom] Judy, <b>going to the bathroom</b>, good for you.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.<br>
<br>
[Monica jumps in the shower. Right after Mrs. Geller enters the bathroom, Mr. Geller peeks
his head in.]<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I
have one.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from <i>Cocoon</i>.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told
Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Really.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: [they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: C'mon, it's my birthday.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are returning from their
brunch.]</b><br>

JOEY: Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: What?<br>
<br>
JOEY: I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place
where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here
by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.<br>
<br>
JOEY: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live
together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well that's how I feel.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well then maybe you should take it.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well then maybe I will.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Fine with me.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the
spoons.<br>

RICHARD: Uhh, not that I know of.<br>

RICHARD: That - that's an idea.<br>

MONICA: Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Oh?<br>

RICHARD: Oh?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ohh.<br>

MRS. GELLER: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of
them aren't. Is that crystal?<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: So, who's the mystery man?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, uh, he's a doctor.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: A real doctor?<br>
<br>
MONICA: No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's
sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]<br>

MONICA: Yes.<br>

MR. GELLER: Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've
never seen Richard happier.<br>

PHOEBE: OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of
the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.<br>

<br>
JOEY: Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling

<br>
PHOEBE: Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's
so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the
right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at

better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me
laugh.<br>

ROSS: Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and
have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock
jokes.<br>

RACHEL: God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...<br>

saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like,
uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?<br>

CHANDLER: Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.<br>

smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind
of irony or somethin.<br>
<br>
<a name="line30"></a> PHOEBE: But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it
was just a dumb soap opera.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have
something nice to say.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me
that's nice.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: It's gonna be ok. You know that?<br>
<br>
JOEY: No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you
think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But
this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card
application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my
life.<br>

you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.<br>

about how women need to become more empowered.<br>

going to the goddess meetings alone.<br>

<a name="line22"></a> MONICA: So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew
it, we'd look like dorks.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.<br>
<br>
MONICA: You're meeting Richard?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah, didn't he tell ya?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were
the guys.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: You hear that? We're the guys.<br>
<br>
JOEY: We're the guys.<br>
<br>
MONICA: With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Thank you.<br>

<a name="line23"></a> ROSS: Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you
say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No luck huh?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into
sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I
gotta take this off.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length]<br>
<br>
<a name="line24"></a> ROSS: What're you doing?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uh, I'm holding Ben.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok.<br>
<br>
<a name="line25"></a> ROSS: Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: This is how I would hold a football.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ok, here, here. There we go.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around
them, I mean, you know, since I was one.<br>
<br>
ROSS: It's alright, it's no big deal.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Really?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What?<br>
<br>
ROSS: What?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: You think about stuff like that?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Two, two babies?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here
won't feel too competitive.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Then what's gonna happen?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we
don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit
whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau
county but the school system's supposedly great.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Huh?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am
gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot.
I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a
door? [leaves]<br>

MONICA: So you watched the movies huh?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and

<br>
RICHARD: Charlotte who?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya

<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah.<br>

PHOEBE: Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, <i>Pride of the Yankees</i>, I thought I
was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.<br>

<br>
<a name="line28"></a> RICHARD: Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with
those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start
sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'<br>
<br>
<a name="line29"></a> MONICA: Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.<br>

who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Sure.<br>
<br>
<a name="line30"></a> MONICA: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know,
and I don't know, what do I do?<br>

your pets head off.<br>

MONICA: I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.<br>
<br>
<a name="line31"></a> MONICA: Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read
Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how
to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next
thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.<br>
<br>

at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for
six weeks.<br>
<br>
ROSS: C'mon, what, you never think about our future?<br>
<br>
<a name="line33"></a> RACHEL: Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep
at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not
think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are
gonna be.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I
thought, I thought that might be good.<br>

<br>
ROSS: The big book of childrens' names.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like
that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not
knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are
gonna have to deal with that.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ok fine.<br>
<br>

<br>
ROSS: We're not done.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I didn't know that.<br>

end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.<br>

<br>
MONICA: Did you like it?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed
the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear
bleed.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty
wonderful?<br>
<br>
<a name="line36"></a> PHOEBE: I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept
getting worse and worse, it should have been called, &quot;It's a sucky life and just when

PHOEBE: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at
the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for
my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite
what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.
I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.<br>

RACHEL: How did you make $17.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, my financially challenged friends, <a name="line44"></a> I split my money
and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.<br>

MONICA: Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think
it sounds zexy.<br>

ok?<br>

<br>
MONICA: So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's
birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.<br>
<br>
ALL: Ohhh.<br>
<br>
MONICA: What?<br>
<br>
<a name="line01"></a> ROSS: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you
poach things?<br>
<br>
MONICA: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<a name="line02"></a> PHOEBE: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun
if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of
party you want.<br>
<br>
[Joey is staring at Monica's breasts]<br>
<br>
<a name="line03"></a> MONICA: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of
these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.<br>

<br>
ROSS: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.<br>
<br>
<a name="line04"></a> JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Why not her?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called
her back.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Joey that is horriable.<br>
<br>
<a name="line05"></a> JOEY: Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know
I guess I just got scared.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, I didn't know.<br>

JOEY: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.<br>

<br>
<a name="line06"></a> ROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.<br>
<br>
<a name="line07"></a> RACHEL: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My
sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what
a girl from long island would do for a Celica.<br>
<br>
MONICA: So what happened?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile
proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the
middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But
you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.<br>
<br>
<a name="line08"></a> PHOEBE: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, how bout just her mom?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Why her mom?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Cause I already invited her.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.<br>

MONICA: Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.<br>

MONICA: [answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing
here?<br>
<br>
MR. GREENE: What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?<br>
<br>
MONICA: No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's
not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.<br>
<br>
MR. GREENE: Ohhh, you're having a parteee.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um,
this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.<br>
<br>
<a name="line10"></a> MR. GREENE: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal?
Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?<br>

<br>
CHANDLER: So, basically just a Chinese guy.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's

MR. GREENE: Alright, that sounds like a two person job. [they walk into Rachel's bedroom]<br>

MRS. GREENE: Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?<br>

CHANDLER: NO! No, I'll take that for ya.<br>
<br>
MRS. GREENE: Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. [Chandler takes the hot pink
coat and grimaces at it] Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons...
[Chandler, remembering that Joey and Mr. Greene are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a
cupboard] The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...[Joey peeks out]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: [cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the
rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun,
c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.<br>

<br>
JOEY: [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast
is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.<br>
<br>
MONICA: So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to
your place.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?<br>

this?<br>

CHANDLER: Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the
bed.<br>
<br>
<a name="line25"></a> RACHEL: Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just
listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of
July.<br>

CHANDLER: Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the
fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill
would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping
and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the
fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we
would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring
another one. And now it's just...<br>

MONICA: Ok, that's enough.<br>
<br>
<a name="line28"></a> PHOEBE: Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, I've got one. [blows out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the

[Rachel brings a muffin to Chandler and Monica who are sitting on the couch.]<br>
<br>
<a name="line01"></a> RACHEL: Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.<br>
<br>
[Rachel holds the tray between them. Chandler grabs the muffin before Monica can.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, I ordered mine first.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...<br>
<br>
MONICA: Give it to me.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: No.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Give it to me.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]<br>
<br>
<a name="line02"></a> MONICA: [She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.]
There you go, enjoy your coffee.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.<br>
<br>
MONICA: [Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the
muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.<br>
<br>
[Chandler is visibly upset]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: You went out with a guy in the Navy?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in
salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have
the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole
weeks, which means yay.<br>
<br>
<a name="line03"></a> RACHEL: So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?<br>
<br>
[Once again, Chandler has a bite in his mouth and can't come back.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: That'll teach you to lick my muffin.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [enters] Hiii.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh no, what happened?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.<br>
<br>
ALL: Oh no.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well I've had it.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, I've had it.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Had it.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Had it.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh

do that. This isn't camp.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am
going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.<br>
<br>
[He walks out of the bedroom and Monica starts to remake the bed.]<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover
it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the
fattest man in the whole damn town?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: What're you doing?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Just waiting for you sweetie.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Are you remaking the bed?<br>
<br>
MONICA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Then, you're redoing it because...<br>
<br>
<a name="line05"></a> MONICA: If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: You're pretty much running that risk either way.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the
bottom right corner.<br>
<br>
<a name="line06"></a> RICHARD: Oh, well that's not so crazy.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I'm just easing you in.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Oh, alright.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down,
because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more
do you.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.<br>
<br>
<a name="line07"></a> MONICA: Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.<br>

<b>[Scene: Chandler's office. Joey is there.]</b><br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can
get you a job right here as an entry level processor.<br>
<br>
JOEY: But don't you need experience for a job like that?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what
you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a
processor.<br>
<br>
SCOTT: [enters] Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.<br>
<br>
SCOTT: No kidding.<br>
<br>
<a name="line08"></a> JOEY: Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the
one they call.<br>
<br>
SCOTT: Where do you work?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're
processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.<br>
<br>
SCOTT: Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...<br>
<br>
JOEY: Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?<br>

RACHEL: Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.<br>

MONICA: You look fabulous honey, you really do.<br>

PHOEBE: Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches
all over her face.]<br>
<br>
<a name="line09"></a> RACHEL: You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I, I, I'm hideous.<br>
<br>
<a name="line10"></a> MONICA: It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna
be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.<br>

<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ryan is walks up to the door and knocks.]</b><br>

PHOEBE: Come in.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Hey baby, I'm back... [Phoebe is sitting by the window in a veil.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Hey Ryan, what's up?<br>
<br>
RYAN: What's goin' on?<br>
<br>
<a name="line11"></a> PHOEBE: Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Chicken or small?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Why aren't you at home in bed?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you
have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.<br>
<br>
RYAN: I'm sorry, I never had 'em.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ohh, ohh.<br>
<br>
<a name="line12"></a> RYAN: If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go
back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub
him all over my face.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Can I please see your face?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is
me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in
terror.] Oh, I am scary.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely,
lovely.<br>
<br>
<a name="line13"></a> PHOEBE: I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two
weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than
this.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about
this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. [He walks to her
and kisses her.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.<br>

<b>[Scene: Chandler's office. Joey enters.]</b><br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey, how's the first day goin'?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column
into another column.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well there you go.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red
hair, Jeannie.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?<br>
<br>
<a name="line14"></a> JOEY: Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world
huh?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Weird world. Your kids?<br>
<br>
<a name="line15"></a> JOEY: I figure my character has kids.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.<br>
<br>
<a name="line16"></a> JOEY: Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff
like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and
Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.<br>
<br>
<a name="line17"></a> JOEY: Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a
third kid... Ya know what? Just did.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe and Ryan are playing Monopoly.]</b><br>

RYAN: You know what makes the itching even worse?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: That you don't stop talking about it.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Fine.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes,
here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama,
just getting ready to roll the dice...<br>
<br>
RYAN: What're you doing? Are you scratching?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. This is what I do for luck, ok.<br>
<br>
RYAN: You're scratching. Give me the dice.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Give me the dice.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.<br>
<br>
RYAN: We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all
these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]<br>
<br>
RYAN: No.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Give it.<br>
<br>
RYAN: No.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just
be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]<br>
<br>
RYAN: Oh God help me.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.<br>
<br>
[They get back to back and start rubbing against each other. Ross and Rachel enter.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, stop that, stop that right now.<br>
<br>
ROSS: You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Chandler's office building. Joey and Jeannie are talking.]</b><br>

JOEY: You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the
kids, we'll make a day of it.<br>
<br>
JEANNIE: Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.<br>
<br>
<a name="line18"></a> JEANNIE: Bye bye Joey.<br>
<br>
JOEY: What a phony.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto
nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Sir.<br>
<br>
MR. DOUGLAS: Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the
systems report until next Friday?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.<br>
<br>
MR. DOUGLAS: I have a family, I'm gonna be here.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah Bing, what's that about?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you
wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.<br>
<br>
MR. DOUGLAS: Rough numbers?<br>
<br>
JOEY: This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.<br>
<br>
MR. DOUGLAS: Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Uh, if you say so sir.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Joseph's good, isn't he?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, I'm going to kill you.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get
in there, ruffle some feathers.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Why?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll
call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.<br>

tape. Richard is sitting on the bed.]</b><br>

MONICA: This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.<br>

<br>
MONICA: It's for their own good.<br>

you now. <a name="line21"></a>Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that
everything on your desk is perpendicular?<br>

MONICA: Very good.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Thank you.<br>

RICHARD: You're gonna do what to my clocks.<br>

MONICA: I'm gonna set them to my time.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.<br>
<br>
<a name="line22"></a> MONICA: No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.
You wanna know why?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.<br>

RICHARD: No come on. Come on tell me.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No. See you don't understand.<br>

RICHARD: Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.<br>

CHANDLER: Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns
out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.<br>

CHANDLER: Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a
lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not
possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.<br>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the whole gang is there as Joey enters]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.<br>
<br>
ALL: Who?<br>
<br>
JOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.<br>
<br>
ALL: Wow!<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to
kiss this guy.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: 'Cause he was just so darn cute.<br>
<br>
JOEY: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy
kisses.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at
him in disbelief) Or you just do it.<br>
<br>
JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Then what's the problem?<br>
<br>
JOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'.
Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good
mother. <br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about
kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.<br>
<br>
OPENING CREDITS<br>
<br>
[Scene: continued from earlier]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey, what did your agent say?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on
Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over
here and kiss me.<br>
<br>
MONICA: What, forget it!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yeah, right.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Come on, I need your help here.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.<br>
<br>
JOEY: You see this, this is a friend.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss
rather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up
a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)<br>
<br>
ROSS: Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler)<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Richard are there]<br>
<br>
ROSS: (entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!
(turns around, and under his breath, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good,
tell her she looks good.<br>
<br>
(Rachel enters in this hideous pink bride's maid dress, with a huge silver bow on her
chest, and a big, huge skirt, kinda like the one's women wore in the 1800s, Monica and
Richard both stare in shock)<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: (laughing) Oh my God, you look so good!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking
like something you drink when your nauseous.</p>

<p>ROSS: So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your
ex-fiancee's wedding.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Because I promised Mindy I would.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. (Rachel glares at her, and she
retreats to safety between Richard's legs)<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I
just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.<br>
<br>
(Chandler enters, sees Rachel in the dress and starts laughing)<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a
little action?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I may have.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Woo-hoo, stuud!<br>
<br>
ROSS: What's she look like?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the
internet.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Woo-hoo, geeek!<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend
get a little defended and quipy...<br>
<br>
ROSS: Get out!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Nooo!<br>
<br>
MONICA: Please!<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I
did.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Wow! What's that like?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: It's like this, me, no jokes.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.<br>
<br>
ALL: Bye, Richard.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Bye sweetie, (kisses him) I love you.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: I love you, too.<br>
<br>
(Monica stares longingly at the door, after Richard leaves)<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.<br>
<br>
MONICA: What are you talking about? What wedding?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Come on, like you never talk that.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to
not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Afraid to ask him?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Could not be more terrified.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel
another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Richard and Monica are playing with Ben.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: (holding up a blanket) Where's Benny? (drops the blanket) There he is! (does it
again) Where's Benny, there he is.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown
ups to cut it out.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure. <br>
<br>
RICHARD: Okay.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Sure I do.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yeah, am I in it?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Honey, you are in it.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Oh, yeah!<br>
<br>
MONICA: Keep talkin'.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France,
make French toast.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little
bassinet in the corner?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Like a hound?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Not a basset, a bassinet.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: You really need the bassinet?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you ,
do you not see kids in our future.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our
kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Look I want you, now.<br>
<br>
MONICA: That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this
is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the
planet.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are there, Chandler is talking to
his new friend on the internet.]<br>
<br>
JOEY: Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. (Chandler ignores him) Just one kiss,
I won't tell anyone.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Joey, no means no!<br>
<br>
[Rachel, in her bridesmaid dress, complete with hat, which makes her look like Little Bo
Peep, and Ross enter]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hey!<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Aww, Rach, I think you look cute (kisses her on the cheek, then looks at Ross) And
you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon (goes to kiss him).<br>
<br>
ROSS: Get away from me I said no!<br>
<br>
MONICA: (entering) Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him (runs out)<br>
<br>
ALL: Bye.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Bye, good luck.<br>
<br>
(Rachel, Ross, and Monica exit)<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that (points
at the computer screen).<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim <i>(sp?, I'm not an art guy)</i>
museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: What does she mean by HH?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: (shyly) It means we're holding hands.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Are you the cutest?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I'm afraid I might just be.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet
for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: It could be like a big giant guy.<br>
<br>
JOEY: (entering) Man, I got this close to him (holds up his fingers) and Monica kneed me
in the back. What's going on?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: How do you not fall down more?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: All right. (reading her answer) &quot;My husband is sleeping with his
secretary.&quot; She's married! <br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Well at least we know she's a woman.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I can't believe she's married.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Aw, man I'm sorry (starts rubbing Chandler's shoulder). This must be very tough for
ya, huh (and starts comfroting him looking for a kiss).<br>
<br>
[Scene: Barry and Mindy's wedding, Monica and Richard are standing in the lobby]<br>
<br>
MONICA: So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed
to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.(they both start laughing at
Richard's poor joke) See, we're having fun.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're
not supposed to think about.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Neither am I.<br>
<br>
[Scene: later the bridesmaids and ushers are getting ready to start, Ross is looking for
Rachel]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hey, there. <br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hi.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Are you all right?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my
wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't,
people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on
the bride.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: God I know, you're right.<br>
<br>
(Annoying wedding planner enters)<br>
<br>
WEDDING PLANNER: All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids
and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Okay, I'll see you after the thing.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Okay, good luck (kisses her and leaves)<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Thank you, Okay, Okay. <br>
<br>
[Starts to walk down the aisle, unfortunately she doesn't realize that her dress is
bunched up in her underwear and her butt is showing.]<br>
<br>
COMMERCIAL BREAK<br>
<br>
[Scene: after the wedding, Ross and Rachel are in the lobby]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Why the hell didn't you tell me!<br>
<br>
ROSS: I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is
showing!'<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was,
was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the
entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my
God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.<br>
<br>
MR. WINEBURG: Rachel!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.<br>
<br>
MR. WINEBURG: It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to
see so much.<br>
<br>
MRS. WINEBURG: You told me you didn't see anything.<br>
<br>
MR. WINEBURG: I tell ya a lot things!<br>
<br>
MRS. WINEBURG: Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.<br>
<br>
MR. WINEBURG: Stay well.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.<br>
<br>
MINDY: (entering) Rach! Rach!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, hi!<br>
<br>
MINDY: Oh my God, I'm married!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I know.<br>
<br>
MINDY: I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.<br>
<br>
BARRY: (entering) Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up
the chopped liver about now.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is
saying that is good to see me up and about?<br>
<br>
MINDY: Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you
were sort of....insane.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Insane!<br>
<br>
MINDY: ...from the syphilis.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What?!<br>
<br>
BARRY: Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey are there, Joey is on the
phone.]<br>
<br>
JOEY: Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that
guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an
Indian and walks into <br>
his room)<br>
<br>
(the computer bing, bongs)<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She
wants to know what's wrong?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.<br>
<br>
(bing, bong)<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, my.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: What?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: She wants to meet you in person.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married,
she has a husband.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you
don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be
kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Okay, I'll do it!<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and
meet her! (Chandler runs and picks up his shoes) Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a
shower, 'cause, eww. (Chandler runs to the bathroom, as the computer bing-bongs) No, you
know what you have to answer her, answer her first. (Chandler runs to the computer) No,
no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. (Chandler walks slowly into the
kitchen)<br>
<br>
[Scene: at Barry and Mindy's reception, Monica and Richard are sitting at a table, and
Monica is trying to throw a piece of candy into his mouth.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Okay, last chance. (Monica throws the candy and hits some woman in the back of
the head, Richard turns around and says) Again, I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
MONICA: You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I
do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that
I...(sees two little girls dancing together) I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I
just do.<br>
<br>
BEST MAN: (standing up) Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast
here. Thank you. (clears throat, and starts reading his toast) I remember when Barry got
home from his first date with Rachel...<br>
<br>
ALL: What?!<br>
<br>
BEST MAN: What, (to Barry) you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. (gets a
'da-doom-chesh' from the drummer) Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both
a wonderful life together. And Rachel...<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What.<br>
<br>
BEST MAN: No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts
to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
(da-doom-chesh)<br>
<br>
ROSS: (standing up) Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh dear God.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel
to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had
syphilis. (da-doom-chesh) (to drummer) What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she
walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out
pretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: (to Ross) She you in the parking lot.<br>
<br>
ROSS: (runs after her) No, Rach!<br>
<br>
BARRY: And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: (after a pause with everyone staring at her, she goes up to the microphone) Ya,
know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised
myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings (da-doom-chesh). See
now, tonight, all I <br>
really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.
Well (laughing), I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really
left to say except....(starts singing) &quot;Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With
yellow feathers (band joins in), feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She
would...&quot;<br>
<br>
ROSS: Marenge,<br>
<br>
RACHEL: (singing) &quot;...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she
like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody..&quot;<br>
<br>
ROSS: Everybody!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: At the Copa, Copa Cabana (everyone joins in) The hottest spot north of Havana. At
the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....<br>
<br>
[Scene: later, Richard and Monica are dancing]<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Okay, I'll do it.<br>
<br>
MONICA: You'll do what?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh my God!<br>
<br>
RICHARD: If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll
go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Really?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all
over again, then I will.<br>
<br>
MONICA: You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like
seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'<br>
<br>
RICHARD: But you're not.<br>

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is reading a script as Ross enters]<br>
<br>
ROSS: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good

Joey).<br>
<br>
JOEY: Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Did not, she did not wink at you...(sees that their sacred couch is
occupied by strangers).</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Huh. (They all leave, dejected)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel and Monica's, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I have to say <em>Tupolo Honey</em> by Van Morrison.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is <em>The Way We Were</em>.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on <em>Who's
The Boss</em>.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What song was that, Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) <em>Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za</em>.</p>

<p>(Monica enters from her bedroom)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi Monica!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Mon!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey Mon!</p>

<p>(she just walks straight into the bathroom)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, has she slept at all?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it's been three nights in a row.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of
Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I
could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a
opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the
phone call.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is coming in from the bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Morning.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Morning, hey, you made pancakes?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (entering and singing) Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man
to cheer up. (laughs hysterically) Good morning Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sarcastically) Good morning.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from
work today and just hang out with me.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go
see my lawyer. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting
divorced. I'm such a grown up.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nope, not this time.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on, quite yankin' me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not <b>yanking</b> you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> This is Janice.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking,
that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at
each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel and Monica's, Monica is entering from the bathroom.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> God, look what I found in the drain.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with
this?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Getting it away from me would be job one.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this
is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your
cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down
the drain.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> God, what is wrong with me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You need to get some sleep.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I need to get some Richard.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of
wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe, because you told him not to.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you the memory woman?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking
up. He didn't blink or anything.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together,
they're really cute.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his
girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All
right who's first? Huh? Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy,
so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's bedroom, Ross is working and Rachel is reading a book in bed]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hmm?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think I have an old band uniform from high school.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You remember not having sex in high school, right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well honey, what about you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on you gotta have one!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you know what...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> ...if you tell me, I might do it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, <em>Return Of The Jedi</em>?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as
his prisoner, um, Princess Leia. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oooh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty
cool.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved
that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she
stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really! That-that great huh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi you guys!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a
parking meter.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mon. Hi! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why aren't you at work?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, they-they sent me home.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know I do.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Guess what?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> They published my paper.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, really, let me see, let me see.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look
like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.
(Ross stands up horrified) There he is.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching Wheel of Fortune, the puzzle is showing
_oun_ Rush_ore.]</p>

<p>[Chandler enters]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wheel!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Of!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got
three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, Janice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go
together, we're like the three hocke-teers.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a
problem with Janice?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler
follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the
Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, there you go.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you
nuts before too, remember?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.
Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, what do you want me to say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I want you to say that you like her!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts
laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have
something to throw at her. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by
the way there is no Count Rushmore!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are entering]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How could you have told her? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other
everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that
locker room stuff.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who
did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Were both of those Joey?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your
girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Not even with your best friend.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Noo!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding
and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same
thing you are.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pretty much.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the
night of five times? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is trying to relax her.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the
plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me
your happy place.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Richard's living room, drinking wine.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And
get out!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to
ask that you don't move anything.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, I'll try not to.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the
warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not
permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and
the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> So, I hear, you hate me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off
and throw it at me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about
our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time
together.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But what does that gonna do...</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> For Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. I'm in.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's <b>DAY
OF FUN!</b>'</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Does it have to be a whole day?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are entering]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was
those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica, do you want us to take you home?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,
and Phoebe leave)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Umm, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,
stamina, girth....</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing
it. Do you wanna?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We're not gonna talk about girth are we?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nooo!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! All right! You go first.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, I'll go first.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies,
and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Princess Leia in the gold bikini.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hmph.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these
like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the
Xerox place....</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And
your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't
possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's
kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the
matter with you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You said...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I said '<b>share</b>' not '<b>scare</b>'. Go sit over there! (Chandler
goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Janice are returning from their DAY OF FUN!]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> We're baack!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you guys doing together?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Joey and Janice's <b>DAY OF FUN</b>!!! (laughs)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I
love this woman. You have got competition buddy.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.
I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You still can't stand her can you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea
Stadium.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I guess that's something.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means
I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into
Ross.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh God!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel and Monica's, Monica is watching the Civil War videos]</p>

<p><strong>Video:</strong>April Twelve, Eighteen hundred, Sixty-One (Monica lights
Richard's cigar butt), 4:30 A.M. on Tuesday, the United States garrison at Fort Sumter was
fired upon (knock on door) it is now under bombardment by.... </p>

<p>(Monica answers the door)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come
into the city for a little Monicuddle. (hugs her) Since when did you start smoking cigars?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you
really doing here Dad?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What makes you think that I might not be okay?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I saw Richard.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> So, how are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> You don't wanna know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, I really, really do.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Well, he's doing terrible!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You're not just saying that are you?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> No, the man is a mess.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Was he crying?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Maybe.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know
after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather,
wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's
nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns
around and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks

hair done up like Princess Leia's, and wearing a belly dancer's outfit, to simulate the
gold bikini thing.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look
on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?
Did you just picture it differently? What? What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom
standing where Rachel is)</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me
out here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around

<b>

<p>Joey:</b> All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes a
glass from the fridge.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Taste it.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> (drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) Yep, it's fat. I drank
fat!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Hey, mister tux!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Why aren't you guys dressed?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> We have a half hour.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at
twenty to eight. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.</p>
<strong>

<p>Chandler and </strong><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (they don't move)</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> (entering from bathroom) Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.</p>

<p>Ross:</b> Really.</p>

<p>Rachel:</b> Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p>Rachel:</b> How come you didn't come over earlier?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Hey, Ross, want some cider?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No. (to Rachel) So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on,
hair's done. </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I just have to get dressed.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.</p>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Ross is acting nervous]</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No! Do you wanna hear it?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Am I in it?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I
sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hello.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Whoa!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Wow, hello! You look great!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Thank you! I know, though.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my
star.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> (entering from bathroom, with an issue of Cosmo) All right, I took the
quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> You're in my seat.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> How is this your seat?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> 'Cause I was sitting there.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> But then you left.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I
was coming back.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the
bathroom). Soo...</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both
have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a
big deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> (entering) Hi.</p>
<strong>

<p>All:</strong> Hey.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> All right all ready.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> (to Ross) Ooh, are you gonna do magic?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> That's, that's funny. Change!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Hang on a second I just got in.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> We could not, would not want to wait.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone
will see if we arrive after it starts.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Has somebody been drinking my fat? (Joey and Chandler look at each other)</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> (entering from her bedroom) You guys, (holds up an outfit) does this look
like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> I don't know, you might be the first one.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Rach, did you check the machine?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look
fat. Nevermind.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> All right! You can have the chair.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Really!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Oh my, would you look at that! (holds up crossed fingers)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> (on machine) &quot;Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm
already there when your playing this message?&quot; (to the guys) Is that too spooky?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> (on machine) &quot;Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel.
Rach!&quot;</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> (entering from her bedroom) What?!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Nevermind.</p>
<strong>

<p>Richard:</strong> (on machine) &quot;Monica, it's Richard. Call me.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) Old or new?! Old or new?!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had
something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the
same thing. And you know what I did?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Huh?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. (Rachel starts to
follow Monica into her room, but Ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) There we
go, there we go.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just
hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in
front of Joey's face) Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not
touching can't get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe's dress)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!</p>
<strong>

<p>Chandler and </strong><b>Joey:</b> Sorry Phoebe.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> I'm so sorry.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> What am I gonna do?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! (clapping) What gets out hummus?! What
gets out hummus?!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> So, should I call him back?</p>
<strong>

<p>The Guys:</strong> Noo! (Monica starts to go back into her room and stops) NO!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. (sits on
Joey's lap) I'm soooo, comfortable.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> All right! (jumps up)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and
change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated
the chair. Okay. Okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and
I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> (entering from her room) Is this a little too... (sees Phoebe) Pheebs, what
happened?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Hummus. I got the hummus.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black
jacket? </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> That won't go with this dress though.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of
that. Come on.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> I called him.</p>
<strong>

<p>All:</strong> Nooo.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God,
what if it wasn't breezy? </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a
breezy place.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me
if it's breezy enough.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Monica, how are you gonna do that?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> I know the code to his answering machine.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are
dialing.</p>

<p>(Chandler enters, and Joey is standing near the chair, they have a show down to see who
gets the chair and Joey wins)</p>
<strong>

<p>Richard:</strong> (on machine) &quot;Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at
the tone.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p>Machine:</b> &quot;You have two new messages.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Wow, what a cool job. (in a machine voice) 'You have two new messages.'
'Please, pass the pie.'</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> (on machine) &quot;Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this
message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So
let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.</p>
<strong>

<p>Woman's Voice:</strong> (on machine) Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me
about this weekend, okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Now she sounded breezy.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier]</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Monica, you don't know that.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Well, who's voice was that?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't
work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> You don't, you don't know what your wearing?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right,
come on, I'll just pick something out for you.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have
noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, &quot;Get out of my chair,
dillhole!&quot;</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> What are you doing?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the
cushions.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> The cushions are the essence of the chair!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> That's right! I'm taking the essence.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this
thing as Little Bo Peep.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! (she's wearing another
dress on a hanger around her neck)</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> We used them as pillows when we went camping.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> (shyly) The sheep.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Hey, what you do on your own time...</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> (entering) Where's my underwear?!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> He took my essence!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're
wearing now?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his
cushions.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> What are you, what are you gonna <b>show</b> me my clothes?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> He's got nothing!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> (entering from Rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) Okay,
I'm ready.</p>
<strong>

<p>Ross and </strong><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, aaaah!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas
ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> What are you supporting?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Duh!! Christmas!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve
minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. (shows Chandler) Okay, see, the, the dinosaur
tail isn't going around any more. (grabs Chandler's watch) What time is it? It's 7:33, I
have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> (entering from her room) Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The
black or the purple?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Just, just, just pick one!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little
strappys?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear
pants?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without
any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in
there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match.
I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> But I...</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> All right.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Thank you!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> (entering from her room) Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that
was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> It was, it was her voice.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.</p>
<strong>

<p>Michelle:</strong> Hola! Hello. Hello?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Okay. That was her right?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Definitely.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Yay!</p>

<p>(phone rings)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> I'll get it, okay. (answers phone) Hi, Monica and Rachel's. (listens) Yeah,
just a second, can I ask who's calling. (to Monica) Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she
must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that. </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> (on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by
mistake. (listens) Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss
him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> (to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But
whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean,
what is that about?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> (on phone) Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean
that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if
you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come
on we're friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Okay, fine. (runs to her room)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> They got a phone in there, right?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Okay, we're on it. We're on it.</p>

<p>(Rachel comes out from her room wearing sweat pants and a sweatshirt)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a
little, um.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> I'm not gonna gooo.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> You're not going to go.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> How, how, um how can you not be going?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Um, you know, just out of curiosity...</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm
just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> It's fine.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No, but, your-your mad.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> I'm not mad. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> I'm just not going.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Your not going.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Okay. You know that I-I have to go.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Um, hum.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No, because your not upset.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> About the yelling.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Right, and the humiliating.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Um, hum.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> We're good.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Okay. Honey?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yes, Ross. (turns toward him)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> I love you. (goes to kiss her and she turns away.)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> (yelling from the bedroom) Get away from that! No! (she comes into the
living room carrying the phone) She's just getting dressed.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?</p>

<p>(Joey enters wearing a lot of clothes)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you
own.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!! </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I <b>be</b> wearing any more clothes? Maybe
if I wasn't going commando...</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Oooo-ooh!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I
don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've
had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Jeez, what a baby.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is
the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I
wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what
can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> You could drink the fat.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.</p>

<p>Ross:</b> Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and
how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake,
with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. (starts to drink, but Rachel stops him just
before he starts drinking)</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> You will?!</p>

<p>Rachel:</b> You were really gonna do that, weren't you?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Well, yeah.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> You were gonna drink the fat.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Let's see what else he'll do!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> (to Joey) How 'bout instead you, go get changed! (to Chandler) You, give him
back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two
minutes! Monica! </p>

<p>(Joey and Chandler start to leave, Joey is lunging as he is walking)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Stop it. Stop it!</p>

<p>(Monica runs into the living room, and starts dialing the phone)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No,
Monica, no!</p>
<strong>

<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message.
Maybe they can change his number. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Rachel!! (she enters) Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!</p>

<p>Rachel:</b> And I still have about five seconds to spare. (kisses him) Okay, that was

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting reading a book and hears the bed in
Joey's room creaking, and does a 'Oh no, not again' look on his face.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (from bedroom) WHOAA!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not
to jump on the bed.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this
morning.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I didn't know there were docks.</p>

<p>[Joey and Chandler enter]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Aww, is it broken?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is
wearing)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it
just *fell* out of the socket.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What is this? Fruit?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica's making jam.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at
our place?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because the kids need new shoes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed
about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man?
Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey
realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> This will just be my batch.</p>

<p>[Scene: Street, Phoebe is being followed by some guy, as they pass a flower vendor.
Phoebe turns around and the guy quickly picks up some flowers and continues following
her.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have
you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> One more chance Ursula, please?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. </p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Wh..</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, you're not a dingus.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet
your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is
just what, what she does to guys, okay.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Well thanks. (starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in
Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was
this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He
said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Not really.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice
guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice.
Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't
have to walk behind me any more.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mon?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mon?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait a minute, look.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, look, look.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, what, what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's an empty apartment.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oooh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We're all alone in an empty apartment.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts
kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
(they fall onto the couch)</p>

<p>(Chandler enters and they both jump up and pretend that Ross is showing her something
in the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There it is.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do I look fat?</p>

<p><strong>Ross and </strong><b>Rachel:</b> Noo.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that
to mean that I was calling her a cow. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at
her....</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's
just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nooo!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And it works both ways.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so you both just know this stuff?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she
gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2
is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's easy, baggage claim.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number
three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice
likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to
go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,
accidentally calling her fat or something.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily
sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right are you guys gonna come down?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good luck Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Bye sweetie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Bye hon.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but
there is something you can do.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room.
Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and
thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm gonna use the cushion.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for
her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back
over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, the old hug and roll.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, one question.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Shoot.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is putting jam on his muffin, lots of jam]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the
movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Looks at him) You're so pretty.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey, Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him
today.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his
name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was
Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause
of the restraining order.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this
very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you
know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you
know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with
crumbs) </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey guys.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey Mon.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds
up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Put your hands together.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No more jam?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what happened to your jam plan?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even.
So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm talking about me having a baby.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my
life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's
when I came up with the baby plan. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that
guy's name? Dad!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if
I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just
stupid.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That, that's what's stupid.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And
there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Down at the docks again?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, Janice and him are cuddling]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Night-night Bing-a-ling.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self)<i> 'Look at
all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird
though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes!
Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay,
time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat!
And 1...2...3!'</i> (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Malcom is giving Phoebe all of his spy stuff]</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> Here's my binoculars.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going
strong. Keep going.</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here
something from it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, not even a little bit.</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> It's about you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay then.</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> (reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm
such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird,
but kinda cool.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good. So what were you thinking?</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay. (he kisses her)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is eating jam straight out of the jar, and Chandler
is staring at him in amazement. Joey offers him some.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on
down! Okay, he's 6'2&quot;, 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean there's more than one of us.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna,
I'm, I'm gonna.....</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You're gonna what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm gonna tell Mom.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Crazy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to
something....</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so
ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Check it out!! Jam crackers!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor,
born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn
and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, the Knicks rule!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, this is you!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> When did you go to a sperm bank?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey,
Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And that's how you bought it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised
there's any of my boys left.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket
scientist here.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives'
on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hellooo!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How's the maniac?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He
quit for me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how
long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following
her?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you saying I should do?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you, Monica.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, (laughs) I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll
thing. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (turns around, not amused) Ross's what?</p>

were still hung up on my sister.</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. (Ursula walks
past, and Malcom finds behind the pillar)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just
walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you
know she takes this train?</p>

<p><b>Malcom:</b> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I
made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause
your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be
like an Ursula patch.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sounds nice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No kiddin', hmm. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? Why?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall,
smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hoyt?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big
pool.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really, is he a swimmer?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He's got the body for it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet,
so don't pee in our pool.', you know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We do not have one of those signs.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great
kids.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Two girls and a boy?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're,
they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of
them.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good
too. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops
hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for
like a day. (hugs her again).</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is finishing off the last of the jam]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of
Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of
the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if
they met me in person.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hello. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I
talk to you for a second?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure. What's up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your
already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys, can we please not watch this all right.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Shhhh!</p>

<p><i><b>Host:</b> Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get
a nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and
these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the
counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!</p>

<p><b>Mike:</b> And there is Kevin.</p>

<p></i><b>Joey:</b> Can we please turn this off?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo way, Kevin.</p>

<p><i><b>Mike:</b> There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never
have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.</p>

<p></i><b>Ross:</b> (to Chandler) Are you intrigued?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!</p>

<p><i><b>Mike:</b> Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how
easy this is to do. (to Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout
that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works
with any milk carton.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.
(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Janice are sitting on the couch, and Phoebe is
sitting next to them in the chair.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it's official there are no good movies.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and lean
back into Monica.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the
couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, man. What's up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at
the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How
could you not give me the message?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was
me! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How is it you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was
in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him
her hand)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yep, that's my audition.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed
my chance.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,
she only talks to agents.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing). </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What, what are you doing? What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice)
'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe,
she'll know what it's about.'</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he
tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani,
apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't
know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment, the world does not stop.'</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is anybody else scared?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is
it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to
Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she
tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, now you want a pad.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are dropping off Ben]</p>

<p><strong>Carol and </strong><b>Susan:</b> (entering) Hey!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a
Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a <em>Barbi</em>?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski
boots and a kicky beret.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and
be in show business.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by
two women, does it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the <em>Barbi</em> thing, so
am I.</p>

<p>(cut to later in the day)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Give daddy the <em>Barbi</em>! Ben, give, give me the <em>Barbi</em>.
Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck
sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
(uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left
boob?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> There it is. Joey, what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm sorry, it just felt nice.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.
Go get me a sweater.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see
her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her
chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Noo.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to
you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm
started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Men are unbelievable.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel
something, you have to run away?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of
thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say
something stupid.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until
you get us to break up with you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, you know about that?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of
the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! </p>

<p>(Joey looks quizzically at Ross)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we
have any thoughts here?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand
it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it
seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear
of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the
most committed guy there ever was.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Amazingly, that makes sense.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You think?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of
the gun, pee into the wind!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm
pretty much peeing every which way.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe's beeper is going off]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and
pretend agents.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on baby, come on!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a
page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Very nice touch.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi
Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work
for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify
yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to
have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a
tunnel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Unbelievable.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's
this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Two?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love
you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooo, four.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Janice are having dinner]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really know
what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into
your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, you didn't have to do this.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what
girlfriends should, should get. </p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought
that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's
more. We should take a trip.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> We should?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your
parents. We should take a trip with your parents!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (laughs) I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right
now! Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have
feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably
say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> You probably want us to move in together?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It doesn't scare me!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You
know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about
moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a
little late, and I-I should just, um...(starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm
hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice
to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna
apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are comforting Chandler]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going
to fast and we have to slow down.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel and </strong><b>Monica:</b> Uff.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That is never good.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then I got all needy and clingy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so
bad. How did you leave it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She said she'd call me.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel and </strong><b>Monica:</b> Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh God.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Welcome to our side of the tunnel.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we
save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch
to low-fat.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, you do.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, you don't think I'm terminal?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some
damage control.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay. So, should I call her?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel and </strong><b>Monica:</b> Nooo!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching
for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want
her back you have to start acting aloof.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> She has to know that your not ready.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose. And then act aloof.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So I'm not, not gonna lose her?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is still trying to get Ben to play with something
other than the Barbi doll.]</p>

real American hero. I'm <em>G.I. Joe</em>!' Drop the <em>Barbi</em>, drop the <em>Barbi</em>.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I
got a shot at it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's okay, these things happen.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,
terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit,
okay, I just quit.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,
rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian
actor with a worse Italian accent.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They actually said that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You
know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in
a very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (normal voice) No. Not anymore.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you
here waiting for me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a
party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Barley? What kind of party serves barley?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> A woman's</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> What woman?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (shyly) Chelsea.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're
seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or,
else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that
I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do
you want to be? (another guy walks by)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can I be that guy?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are there]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, shoot.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I didn't get it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can
work on that. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, what else?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this
Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at
least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, no, I understand.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You do, thanks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait a minute.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of
being my agent.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream
now, right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what, everything's gonna be okay. </p>

<p>(phone rings)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?
Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke
up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, and grumpy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm
so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just
because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a
couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody
else by now.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) I love you too.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are picking up Ben, while Monica is
pouring chocolate syrup, lots of it, into her ice cream.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, <em>G. I. Joe</em>'s in, <em>Barbi</em>'s out. And if you guys can't
deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You
used to dress up like a woman.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, you are totally making this up.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (remembering) Oh God.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> I've literally never been this happy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wasn't there a little song?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh please God, let there be a song.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (singing) '<em>I am Bea.</em>'</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> '<em>I drink tea.</em>'</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> '....<em>Won't you, won't you, won't you</em>.... '</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No. Y'know how we&#146;re always saying we need a place for the mail.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next
step.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&#146;re building a post office?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It&#146;s a
one day job, max.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word!
Those are snug.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente&#146;s.</p>

Mom&#146;s dead, don&#146;t talk to my sister, Grandma&#146;s been sleeping a lot lately.
It&#146;s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing.
You&#146;re so sweet to wait with me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, actually Gunther sent me. You&#146;re not allowed to have cups out

<p>[Scene: inside Central Perk]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put
him on her freebie list.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Her what?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that
we can sleep with, and the other one can&#146;t get mad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex
with celebrities.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, Chandler, who&#146;s on your list?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah,
Jessica Rabbit.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Now, you do realize that she&#146;s a cartoon, and way out of your
league?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop
out of her head.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Monica, who would yours be?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s just a game Mon. (makes a &#145;Can-you-believe-her&#146; face

hooker.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, we don&#146;t really take advantage of living in the city.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I do <b>NOT</b> want this unit!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you should&#146;ve told me that before, I&#146;m not a mind reader.
Hey, we&#146;re out of beer. I&#146;m going to Monica&#146;s.</p>

half of the door.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those
designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why, what&#146;s wrong with my bathroom floor?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nothing. It&#146;s just old and dingy, that&#146;s all.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to
be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&#146;t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes
right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in
his tight pants.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s a little more than I wanted to see.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of
this stuff is glued down. It&#146;d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should
just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&#146;t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.</p>

<p>(Joey places the toliet brush and holder over the hole, which is in the middle of the
floor.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Eh! There you go.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know that&#146;s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue?
Because I can, and my Mom couldn&#146;t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was

<p><b>Frank:</b> What, wait, you mean like this? (does it)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can&#146;t)</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Your not doing it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Susan Sarandon.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Eh, y'know what, she&#146;s to political, she probably wouldn&#146;t
let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And!! Isabella Rosselini.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she&#146;s too
international, y'know she&#146;s never gonna be around.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who&#146;s gonna be in the
country like all the time.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, &#145;cause that&#146;s why you won&#146;t get Isabella Rosselini,
geography.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She wasn&#146;t a hooker.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. </p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey&#146;s, everyone is there, helping to lift the entertainment
center into place]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, on three. One....Two....</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why don&#146;t we just go on two.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why two?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Because it&#146;s faster.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this
&#145;two&#146; talk.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, but in the future...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay!! Okay!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Heavy thing, not getting lighter!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, one...two...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So we are going on two?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem,
the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, good job Joe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow, it&#146;s big!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe, my ruler&#146;s wrong.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe all the rulers are wrong.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look it&#146;s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a
little of my door.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how &#145;bout it blocks
none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move
it, but it doesn&#146;t move.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is serving some guy coffee.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,
double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy
nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.</p>

<p>(Isabella Rosselini enters)</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (to Gunther) Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> (to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please.</p>

<p>(Ross recognises her and goes over to the couch, mouthing &#145;Oh my God&#146;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Damn! I can&#146;t believe I took her off my list.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why? &#145;Cause otherwise you&#146;d go for it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, maybe.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh, you lie.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What you don&#146;t think I&#146;d go up to her?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You know what honey, you go ahead, we&#146;ll call her an alternate.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, hold my crawler.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, he&#146;s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I&#146;m just
sorry we don&#146;t got popcorn.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I&#146;m Ross, you don&#146;t know me, but I&#146;m
a big, big fan of yours. I mean, <i>Blue Velvet</i>, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I
could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you
for that one? </p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> Aren&#146;t you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, who
waves back)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that&#146;s okay, see we have an understanding,
um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I&#146;m allowed
to sleep with you. No, no, no, it&#146;s flattery.</p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> I&#146;m sorry. (starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don&#146;t, don&#146;t just dismiss
this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...</p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> Yeah, for you. Is that the list?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> May I see it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, no.</p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> Come on! (grabs the list)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But, okay.</p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> (reading it) I&#146;m not on the list!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, see, but that&#146;s not the final draft.</p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> It&#146;s laminated!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler
(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped
you for Wynona Rider, local.</p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> Y'know it&#146;s ironic...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Isabella:</b> ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday
I bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to the rest of the gang) We&#146;re just gonna be friends.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey&#146;s, they are admiring the entertainment center]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know what?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Umm?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I bet &#145;ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;ve got five bucks says you can&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Get out your checkbook, mister.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I think I have the cash.</p>

<p>(Joey successfully enters the entertainment center, and Chandler closes the door on
Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You are dogged man! I totally fit!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so
that the doors won&#146;t open) I&#146;m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack
between the door and frame) Here you go.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.
Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks
are on me!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the whole gang is there including Janice.]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of
you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, it&#146;s like a dirty math problem.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, that&#146;s really a different question.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I&#146;m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who
spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.</p>

<p><b>Monica and Rachel:</b> What?!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me, there was no time!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, but let&#146;s say there was. How might that go?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Does anybody need more coffee?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I&#146;ll take some.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, there&#146;s a dog out there!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Phoebe&#146;s, three years earlier, Phoebe, Monica, and Ross are
there]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, that is so unfortunate.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from bedroom) Okay, I&#146;ll be back in just a minute. Oh,
Phoebe I&#146;m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You didn&#146;t leave lipstick marks on the phone.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, then it must&#146;ve been you. Bye. (leaves)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That&#146;s why I moved out.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, y'know while we&#146;re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister
that you don&#146;t live here anymore.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think on some levels she already knows.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe, she doesn&#146;t know that you sneak out every night, she
doesn&#146;t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn&#146;t know that
you&#146;ve been living with your Grandmother&#146;s for a week now.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, well maybe not on those levels.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, with a goatee) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m never gonna find a roommate, ever.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why, nobody good?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well let&#146;s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that&#146;s
plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need
to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing <i>Bing!</i>
Great apartment Chandler Bing, <i>Bing!</i></p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So how many more do you have tomorrow?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,
who I&#146;m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone
&#145;Chandler Bing,&#146; he said &#145;Whoa-whoa, short message.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the
floor or come over no more!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Umm, how&#146;s it going with you guys?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were
having so much trouble lately.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn&#146;t really have any
close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan
something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it&#146;s gonna make a difference</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s, Chandler is interviewing a potential roommate.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?</p>

<p><b>Eric:</b> Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope
that&#146;s cool.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.</p>

<p><b>Eric:</b> Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister&#146;s
beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell
you, she&#146;s a porn star. (Chandler breaks his pencil in half)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless
it turns out to be your sister, I think you&#146;re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers
to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s, Chandler is interviewing Joey.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom.
Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door)
Bye-bye.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don&#146;t you ah, don&#146;t you wanna ask me any questions?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure. Ummm. What&#146;s up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, ah, I&#146;m an actor. I&#146;m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV.
Oh, and don&#146;t worry I&#146;m totally okay with the gay thing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What gay thing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I&#146;m totally cool
with that.</p>

<p>[Scene: the hallway, Monica is coming up the stairs.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.</p>

<p>(Joey is leaving and notices Monica, as Monica notices him)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p>(Joey leaves and Monica mouths to Chandler &#145;Oh my God!&#146;)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Mon.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do I ever.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chris says they&#146;re closing down the bar.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No way!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, apparently they&#146;re turning it into some kinda coffee place.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Got me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to bartender) Can I get a beer.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, did you pick a roommate?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You betcha!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is it the Italian guy?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Um-mm, yeah right!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He&#146;s so cute.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes, and that&#146;s what I want a roommate that I can walk around
with and be referred to as the funny one.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh look, the pool table&#146;s free. Rack &#145;em up. I&#146;ll be back
in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but after that, we&#146;re shootin&#146; some pool.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no,
no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I
ordered a rum and <i>Diet Coke</i>, which I don&#146;t think this is.</p>

<p><b>Waitress:</b> I am so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a
couple drinks right, huh?</p>

<p><b>Friend No. 1:</b> Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one
year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ummm, I think it&#146;s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out
and they all scream)</p>

<p><b>Friend No. 2:</b> Oh, isn&#146;t it exciting, I mean it&#146;s like having a
boyfriend for life.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>Friend No. 1:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I don&#146;t know. Well maybe it&#146;s just the idea of Barry for
the rest of my life. I don&#146;t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,
y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)</p>

<p><b>Friend No. 1:</b> Rachel stop!</p>

<p><b>Friend No. 2:</b> You&#146;re so bad!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m serious, I really, I think I need just to have
some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.</p>

<p>(Chandler throws the cue ball under there table.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, so?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (picks it up) And now I&#146;ve picked it up again. (walks over to
Monica.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, you can&#146;t even see where the Titanic hit it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, his name is Barry, he&#146;s a doctor, thank you very much.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you. So how-how &#145;bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aww, not right now.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, but that&#146;s okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>(An awkward silence)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, I&#146;ll get-get back to my friend.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the
cue ball as a &#145;Remember me?&#146; thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next
time I&#146;m in the city?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that&#146;d be great.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Bye!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my
life.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Phoebe&#146;s, Ross is on the phone, as Phoebe is walking by
carrying a lamp.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No real-, honey, really it&#146;s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I,
no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So what are they doing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t know, something girlie.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Monica, who&#146;s entering) Hey, you&#146;re early.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing with the lamp?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m just taking it to be re-wired.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, well don&#146;t take it to the same place you took the stereo,
&#145;cause they&#146;ve had that thing for over a week.</p>

<p>(There is a knock on the door, Phoebe answers it, its Mr. Heckles)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> You&#146;re disturbing my oboe practice.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You don&#146;t play the oboe!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> I could play the oboe!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Then I&#146;m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in
his face.)</p>

<p>(in the hallway, Eric is moving in)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> (to Eric) Who are you?</p>

<p><b>Eric:</b> Hi, I&#146;m Eric, I&#146;m gonna be Chandler&#146;s new roommate.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> I&#146;m Chandler&#146;s new roommate.</p>

<p><b>Eric:</b> I-I-I don&#146;t think so.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> I could be Chandler&#146;s new roommate.</p>

<p><b>Eric:</b> But, he told me over the phone.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> He told me in person.</p>

<p><b>Eric:</b> That&#146;s weird.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> Well, I&#146;m going to go into my new apartment now. (goes over to
the door and opens it) Ehh! (Eric leaves)</p>

<p>(inside Chandler&#146;s apartment, Chandler is coming in from his bedroom, sees Mr.
Heckles, and screams.)</p>

<p>[Scene: the hallway, Joey is moving in, Monica is leaving.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi, again.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! (goes into the apartment)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (leaving to go to work) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you soo, much.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, don&#146;t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I
gotta get to get to work.</p>

<p>(Joey comes back into the hallway and starts to pick up a heavy box)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You want some help with that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don&#146;t!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Whoa! Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away)
And-and the humidity.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s a uh, that&#146;s a tough combination.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Like you wouldn&#146;t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is
a great place.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This place is really my Grandmother&#146;s. (Joey starts to take off all
of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her
when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the
landlord ever asks, I&#146;m 87 year old woman, who&#146;s afraid of her VCR. So are you
thirsty?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, you bet I am!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (turning around) Okay, here&#146;s your penis!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, ah!! We&#146;re you just gonna give me some lemonade?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh right, right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to
you that means they wanna have sex?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I&#146;m such a jerk.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,
but... By the way I can still see it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Phoebe&#146;s, Monica is vacuuming.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Where&#146;s your bed?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&#146;s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a &#145;Come on&#146;
look) Oh no. I can&#146;t believe this is happening again.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I&#146;ve, I don&#146;t live here
anymore.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m sorry, I-I-I-I don&#146;t live here anymore. I-I didn&#146;t
know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Everybody knows!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,
I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn&#146;t sleep for like a month because I got
like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I would&#146;ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other
side.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, this is what I&#146;m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a
land where people can spill.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You can spill. In the sink.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Aw, honey it&#146;s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I
love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don&#146;t see that
happening.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I love you, too. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Aww, good. (they hug) What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What? I&#146;m just said.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No you&#146;re not, you&#146;re wondering which cushion it is.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, (now) Joey is watching <i>Baywatch</i>, as Chandler enters
from his bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So ah, whatcha watching?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> <i>Baywatch.</i></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What&#146;s it about?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Lifeguards.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who&#146;s she?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.</p>

<p>(<i>Baywatch</i> goes into one of those running scenes.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow! Look at them run.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I&#146;ll go get one.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, no, don&#146;t get up, I got a cooler right here.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica&#146;s, Monica is coming out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a
towel, as Chandler is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, hello!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do you have any beers? We&#146;re out of beers.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (all depressed) Help yourself.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe moved out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I
don&#146;t have a boyfriend?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Noo!! You don&#146;t have a boyfriend because....I don&#146;t, I
don&#146;t know why you don&#146;t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I think so.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my
favourite people and the most beautiful woman I&#146;ve ever known in real life.</p>

<p>[Scene: the bar, Ross is entering, Phoebe is at the bar, they are the only two in the
place.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&#146;s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is
wrong?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no! Why?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> &#145;Cause Carol&#146;s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I&#146;m
not one. And apparently it&#146;s not a mix and match situation.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! I don&#146;t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many
drinks) I&#146;m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I&#146;d be out and
she&#146;d, she&#146;d see some beautiful woman, and, and she&#146;d be Ross y'know look
at her, and I&#146;d think, God, my wife is cool!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, now I do!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Seven years. I mean we&#146;ve been together seven years, she&#146;s the
only woman who&#146;s ever loved me, and the only woman I&#146;ve-I&#146;ve ever....</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica&#146;s, Chandler and Monica are still hugging each other.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Umm, this is nice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know, it is isn&#146;t it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle
a nuclear device.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,
it&#146;s, it&#146;s gonna be....</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)</p>

<p>[Scene: the bar, Phoebe is still hugging Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Maybe this would&#146;ve happened if I&#146;d been more nurturing, or
I&#146;d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can&#146;t believe this!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know no, no, y'know you don&#146;t deserve this, you don&#146;t Ross.
You&#146;re, you&#146;re really, you&#146;re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And you&#146;re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And
you&#146;re kind (kisses him on the lips)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)</p>

<p>(They pause, and they the start kissing passionately, and taking off each others
clothes, and they start to lie down on the pool table.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Huh?</p>

<p>(Ross tries to clear off the pool table by knocking the balls to the other end of the
table, but they all bounce back, and he frantically starts to throw them into the
pockets.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, it&#146;s okay.</p>

<p>(Phoebe jumps on to the table and lays down, Ross follows her and hits his head on the
light hanging over the pool table.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. (they start kissing again)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait, wait, wait.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My foot is stuck in the pocket.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I can&#146;t get it out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, that&#146;s not something a girl wants to hear.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, come on don&#146;t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)</p>

<p>(They both look at each other and start laughing (Lisa almost lost it there), and sit
up. Ross hits his head on the lamp again.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh well. It probably would&#146;ve been the most constructive solution.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You have chalk on your face.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, Ross you&#146;re right, I don&#146;t know why I always thought this
was real grass.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My wife&#146;s a lesbian.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Cool!!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: the bar, Chandler is playing pool, as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&#146;t believe you came back.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Don&#146;t say anything. I don&#146;t wanna speak, I don&#146;t wanna
think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.</p>

<p>(She hits the jukebox Fonzy style, and <i>It&#146;s That Time of Season</i> starts to
play, as they start to kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Friend No. 2:</b> Rachel! Rachel! (stirs Rachel from her dream, she&#146;s in her
car driving back from the city)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Friend No. 2:</b> You missed the exit!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, sorry.</p>

<p><b>Friend No. 1:</b> My God, what were you thinking about?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, (shyly) Barry.</p>

<p><b>Her Friends:</b> Awwww!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the whole gang is there, Ross is telling a story about what
happened at work and the rest of the gang are thinking to themselves, denoted by italics.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So I told Carl, &#145;Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are,
nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.&#146; But of course this went in one ear and
out.....</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend
he&#146;s Alan Alda.</i></p>

watching <i>Happy Days</i>.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey. When you guys were kids and you played <i>Happy Days</i>, who were
you? I was always Richie.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I was always Joanne.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Question. Was ah, &#145;Egg the Gellers!&#146; the war cry of your
neighbourhood?</p>

<p>(A commercial for the Mattress King, Janice&#146;s ex-husband, comes on TV.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ewww! Oh! It&#146;s the Mattress King!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Booo!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Janice) Don&#146;t look honey. Change the channel! Change the
channel!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine.</p>

<p><b>Matress King:</b> (on TV) <i>&#145;Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom
is suddenly without a queen. I&#146;m so depressed I&#146;m going to slash... my prices!!
Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I&#146;m going medieval on
prices!</i></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What a wank!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, I cannot believe he&#146;s using our divorce to sell mattresses.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about
the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I&#146;m
appalled for you by the way.</p>

<p><b>Matress King:</b> (on TV) <i>I&#146;m close. I&#146;m cheap. I&#146;m the king.</i></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is on the phone, everyone else is there except Joey.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> &#145;Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we&#146;ll see you tomorrow night.
(listens) Okay bye-bye.&#146; (hangs up)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that&#146;s
okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh shoot, tomorrow&#146;s not so good, I&#146;m supposed to um, fall off
the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, my father doesn&#146;t hate you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Please, he refers to me as &#145;wethead&#146;.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all
right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you
like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do
come to dinner, I&#146;ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (leaning in) I&#146;ll go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi Gunther.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Yeah, we&#146;ll see!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey, you guys!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Guess what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I got a gig!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yay!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> See, that&#146;s why I could never be an actor. Because I can&#146;t
say gig.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I can&#146;t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What&#146;s the part?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, it&#146;s not a part, no. I&#146;m teaching acting for soap operas
down at the Learning Extension.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! That&#146;s great.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, yeah. It&#146;s like my chance to give something back to the acting
community.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&#146;know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (glares at him) I know!</p>

<p>[Scene: Mattress King, Monica and Phoebe are shopping for a new mattress.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ugh! I don&#146;t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if
you buy a bed from Janice&#146;s ex-husband, that&#146;s like betraying Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Not at these prices.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in
England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and
she makes the &#145;that went right over your head&#146; motion) Woo!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this
is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler&#146;s your friend...
(hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other
friends.</p>

<p>[Scene: Classroom. Joey is writing his name on the board, but turns around before
he&#146;s done which causes him to write his name with a downward curve, and he then
underlines it, and draws the line right through his name.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good evening. I&#146;m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for
soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on <i>Days of Our
Lives</i>, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of
the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting
again, it means, you don&#146;t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like
this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks,
thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will
have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Phoebe is already there waiting for the
delievery guy.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, &#146;Hey, the bell
doesn&#146;t dismiss you, <b>I</b> dismiss you.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooooh, nice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for <i>All My Children</i>.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yay!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, it&#146;s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I&#146;m so,
so right for it, y'know, he&#146;s just like me. Except he&#146;s a boxer, and has an evil
twin.</p>

<p>(There is a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this <b>huge</b> black
delievery guy.) </p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. (to
Phoebe) You Miss Geller?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Sign here. (hands her a clipboard)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It&#146;s
that bedroom there. (points to Monica&#146;s room)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, so please, please, please, don&#146;t say anything to Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You want me to lie to Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Is that a problem?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let&#146;s see what you got. All right ya,
put &#145;em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, you&#146;re ah, pretty good at this.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young
men weren&#146;t acting Christian enough.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahh!</p>

<p>(Joey throws a punch and just lightly taps her on the shoulder, Phoebe counters with a
jab to the nose.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey now!</p>

<p>(Phoebe throws another jab, and lands it on Joey&#146;s nose, causing it to bleed.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!!! Oww!! And I&#146;m bleeding.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Oh! Oh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, great.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! And I&#146;m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I&#146;m
sorry, we&#146;ll put some ice on it. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &#145;Kay, put your head back.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. I can&#146;t see.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I have ya. Oh God.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&#146;s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Restaurant, Rachel and Ross and Dr. Green are having dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi Daddy!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> This where they put it? What, there no table available in the
kitchen! Hello, baby.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You remember Ross.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Um-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nice to see you again Dr. Green. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green is
successful.) (to Ross) How&#146;s the library?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ugh, museum.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> What happened to the library?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,
I never worked at one.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> You know what&#146;s really good here, the lobster. What do you say
shall I just order three.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, if you&#146;re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a
joke, I made a joke.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of
person that works at a library.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s not a library...</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> (interrupting him) I know!! It&#146;s a museum! What, you&#146;re the
only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will
have two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I don&#146;t know to the waiter.)</p>

<p>[Scene: After dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, Dr. Green, how&#146;s the old boat.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It gives it a nice antiquey look.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> (he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow. I&#146;m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel
giggles at that)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to
the Levines, before we go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aw honey stop! It&#146;s not that bad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must&#146;ve added
wrong. He only tipped like four percent.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. That&#146;s Daddy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s Daddy?! But doesn&#146;t it bother you? You&#146;re a
waitress.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee
house, I&#146;d be serving him sneezers.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So. Ross, I&#146;ve bugged him about this a million times, he&#146;s not
gonna change.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You really serve people sneezers?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well um, <b>I</b> don&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Dr Green:</b> You kids ready?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks again, Dr. Green.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> All right.</p>

<p>(Ross takes a twenty and slips it underneath the bill when Dr. Green isn&#146;t
looking.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, ah, you don&#146;t need that.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The carbon, it&#146;s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,
the, the ah, night blindness.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> (gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a
twenty down here? Huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too
much, way, way, too much, it&#146;s a sickness really.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something
about that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Excuse me, you think I&#146;m cheap?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh Daddy, no he didn&#146;t mean anything by that, he really
didn&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nothing I do means anything, really.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down
twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?
Here, I&#146;ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips up
the bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well Mr. Big Shot is better than &#145;wethead&#146;.</p>

<p>[Scene: Classroom, Joey is lecturing on facial expressions.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I&#146;ve never been able to cry as
an actor, so if I&#146;m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a
pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let&#146;s say I wanna convey that
I&#146;ve just done something evil. That would be the basic &#145;I have a fishhook in my
eyebrow and I like it&#146; (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend
fishhook.) Okay, let&#146;s say I&#146;ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try
and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that&#146;s how it&#146;s done. Great soap
opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Hey, Mr. Trib.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey-hey.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Guess what, I got an audition!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Awww, one of my students got an audition. I&#146;m so proud.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You bet! What&#146;s the part?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Oh it&#146;s great, it&#146;s a role on <i>All My Children</i>, Nick
the boxer.</p>

<p>(Joey does the &#145;232 divided by 13 bad news&#146; look.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Hallway, Ross and Rachel are returning from dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You had to do it, didn&#146;t you? You couldn&#146;t just leave it
alone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there&#146;s a bug in my
food.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and
rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I&#146;m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.</p>

<p>(they go into Monica and Rachel&#146;s, and see Phoebe hopping around.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m, I&#146;m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something
and she shouldn&#146;t have! All right, I haven&#146;t lived here in a while, so I have to
ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um. yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I am <b>soo</b> dead. (goes to Monica&#146;s room)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, look, here&#146;s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if
we act fast, okay. So, I&#146;ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn&#146;t work.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that&#146;s
why you have got to be the bigger man here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I
could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn&#146;t make any difference, except
that I could pick your Father up and say &#145;Like me! Like me tiny doctor!&#146;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, well can&#146;t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For
me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay
we&#146;re never gonna get along.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a
Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don&#146;t wanna
have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I&#146;ll get the bagels.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica&#146;s bedroom, Phoebe is trying to hide the bed from Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This is not the bed I ordered!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know, you must&#146;ve won like a contest or something! </p>

<p>(Phoebe starts to make a sound like a car accelerating)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe!</p>

<p>(Phoebe makes a sound like a car screeching to a halt.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why is this car in my bedroom?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m sorry, okay, I-I wasn&#146;t looking, and the store says that
they won&#146;t take it back because you signed for it...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> When did I sign for it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> When I was you! Y'know what, it&#146;s all Joey&#146;s fault,
&#145;cause he left his nose open!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did you make brownies today?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Knock, knock.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won&#146;t notice the bed.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, I&#146;m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the
bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&#146;s Monica&#146;s bed. What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (to Monica) It&#146;s a racecar.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So. This has always been Monica&#146;s bed, what you&#146;re just
noticing now, how self-involved are you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, well it this bed isn&#146;t new, how come there is plastic on
the mattress?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers
her, her hand to comfort her.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Classroom, Joey is coaching his student.]</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas,

<p><b>Student:</b> No.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there, yelling at Joey.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You told him to play the boxer gay!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I-I might&#146;ve said supergay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You totally screwed him over.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, you&#146;re this guy&#146;s teacher. I mean how could you do this?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Because, Monica, the guy&#146;s so good, and I really, really want this
part.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, if you really, really want it, then it&#146;s okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is greeting her Father for their brunch.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? What? He&#146;s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just
wants to know how you got here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, please. Sweetie it&#146;s hopeless, okay, I&#146;m just gonna go.
(starts to leave rubbing his neck)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, look I&#146;m sorry. It&#146;s just that....</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Ross? What&#146;s with the neck?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> He&#146;s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my
chiropractor...</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> You&#146;re still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn&#146;t
get into medical school in Extapa!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you! That&#146;s what I keep saying.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well that&#146;s his last name.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And his first name.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> He&#146;s Bobby Bobby?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&#146;s Robert Bobby.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And um, excuse me, he helps me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-ho please. Ask her how?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> What do you need help for?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> With my alignment. I&#146;ve got one leg shorter than the other.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Oh God!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Argue with that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? It&#146;s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Come on! You&#146;re just titling! (to Ross) Her legs are fine!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know that!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m sorry, let her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What can I do, she doesn&#146;t listen to me about renter&#146;s insurance
either.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Wait a minute, you don&#146;t have renter&#146;s insurance?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after
him with one leg shorter than the other?!</p>

<p>(Both he and Ross start laughing)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Green:</b> I&#146;d love some juice. Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah honey, I&#146;m standing right there! Why didn&#146;t you just tell
him about the mole I haven&#146;t got checked yet.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Excellent!</p>

<p>[Scene: Classroom, Joey is talking to his students.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you&#146;ll
have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the
recent, present. And I&#146;m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to
play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned
out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he&#146;s got a two
year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me
I&#146;m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on
TV. I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from
his students.) Thank you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Mattress King, Monica is trying to return her bed.]</p>

<p><b>Jester:</b> Uh, may I help you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I&#146;m the lady that got stuck
with the racecar bed.</p>

<p><b>Jester:</b> Look, it&#146;s like I told you, there&#146;s nothing I can do. You
signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.</p>

<p><b>Jester:</b> Nobody sees the king!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-ho-kay, I&#146;m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)</p>

<p><b>Jester:</b> Hey! You can&#146;t go back there!</p>

<p>(Joey goes to the door, but stops and looks through the window at Janice and the
Mattress King, her ex-husband, kissing.)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh my God.</p>

<p>(Joey fakes a scream.)</p>

sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin&#146;! (honks the
bed&#146;s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)
All right, I&#146;ll leave. My bed&#146;s so boring.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)</p>

<p>(Phoebe takes a bite and spits it out and screams.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I&#146;m not gonna have one.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, it&#146;s just my tooth.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right I&#146;ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So what&#146;s a matter, you need a dentist? I&#146;ve got a good one.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can&#146;t see him.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> See that is the problem with invisible dentists.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why? Why can&#146;t you go to him?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down
the hygienist&#146;s blouse.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,
my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend &#145;Albino Bob&#146;.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And all these people actually died?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, while I was in the chair! That&#146;s why I take such good care of
my teeth now, y'know, it&#146;s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, come on, you didn&#146;t kill anybody, these people just happened
to die when you went to the dentist. It&#146;s, it&#146;s, it&#146;s just ah, a
coincidence.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well tell that to them. Oh! You can&#146;t, their dead.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Oh, like you don&#146;t already have everything.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, fine, fine, but if you&#146;re my next victim, don&#146;t

not.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going
to tell Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to
not.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, you can&#146;t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you
have to tell him.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;ll kill him. I mean it&#146;ll, it&#146;ll just kill him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, you could wait &#145;til I go to the dentist, maybe <b>I&#146;ll</b>
kill him.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, All are there except for Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.
It&#146;s like a <i>Play-Doo</i> Fat Factory. </p>

they rearranged the figures, let&#146;s just leave it at that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, I don&#146;t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me,
because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Why are your eyes so white?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You tell me! Maybe, it&#146;s because I was just fooling with my ex!
Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh my God!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> How did you know?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> In the park?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! In his office! How many kisses were there?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Just those two!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no
kissing!!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, I&#146;m sorry honey, I&#146;m so, so, (nasally) haaaaa! I&#146;m
so, so sorry, I just (nasally) haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can&#146;t
breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (giving her a bag) Here.</p>

<p>(Janice starts to breath into it and sucks in the reciept, and then spits it out.)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> The receipt.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with
me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do
you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her
head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I&#146;m gonna need an actual answer here okay,
so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (rushing in) Okay. If you&#146;re alive you answer your phone!</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey are there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, Ben, I won&#146;t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for
dinner, if you don&#146;t tell about our little bonking incident.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, number one, I don&#146;t think Ben understands the concept of
bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You said number two.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I also said number one.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know. (giggles harder)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey! Everyone.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How&#146;s my little boy?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> He&#146;s perfect, he&#146;s never been better.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What&#146;d you do, take him whaling?</p>

<p><b>Ben:</b> Monica.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God, he just said your name, that&#146;s great! Good job Ben.</p>

<p><b>Ben:</b> Monica bang!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh that&#146;s right, that&#146;s what I&#146;d sound like if I
exploded.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is
alive.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)</p>

<p>[Cut to later, all except Chandler are staring out the window at Ugly Naked Guy.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting
stronger too, to bring down something that big.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well maybe he&#146;s just taking a nap.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;m tellin&#146; ya, he hasn&#146;t moved since this morning.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, we should call somebody.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn&#146;t
moving.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, we have gotta find out if he&#146;s alive.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How are we gonna do that? There&#146;s no way.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, there is one way. His window&#146;s open, I say, we poke him.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is throwing darts, as Joey enters.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when
we get Chinese food?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, now we got a reason.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, we&#146;re fashioning a very long poking device.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey uh, what&#146;s a matter?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I talked to Janice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God, is she going back to him?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She doesn&#146;t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this
morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that
twelve pack of condoms. And now I can&#146;t even return them, because she choked on the
reciept!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you ah, what are you gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, it doesn&#146;t matter what I would do.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, tell me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, you&#146;re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it
was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I
would bow out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey
quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They have a kid together, y'know. They&#146;re like, they&#146;re like a
family, and if, I don&#146;t know, there&#146;s chance they could make that work, I know I
wouldn&#146;t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna
ah, come poke a nude guy?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross has just finished putting Ben to sleep, and is
entering from Rachel&#146;s room.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, he&#146;s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are you, are you, are you sure it&#146;s ah, a new bump? I mean, no
offense, I&#146;ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,
y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (confidently) I did!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know! I&#146;m saying you have to watch them all the time.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against
that thing!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica did it?</p>

<p>(Monica runs into the kitchen from the terrace.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. Why?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet
song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he&#146;s leaving out &#145;e&#146;
and &#145;f.&#146; It&#146;s like they just ah, I don&#146;t know, fell out of his head.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, and also, he&#146;s, he&#146;s walkin&#146; kind of funny, his left
leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he&#146;s in there just sort of
y'know... (walks around in a circle) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I hope it&#146;s still funny when you&#146;re in hell.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
(starts to chase Ross around the living room)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;ll get the hat.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Janice are there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me
get through it, because it&#146;s, it&#146;s, it&#146;s not gonna be easy.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think you should go back with Gary. I don&#146;t wanna be the guy
that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know &#145;You&#146;re the reason, you are
the reason why their not together.&#146; and I hated that guy. And it didn&#146;t matter
how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well. It&#146;s the right thing to do.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh! You&#146;re right. Oh God. But, before I can say
&#145;good-bye&#146;, there&#146;s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way
I feel about you, it&#146;s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie&#146;s been
singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it&#146;s like movie love, you&#146;re my
soulmate, and I can&#146;t believe we&#146;re not going to be spending the rest of our
lives together.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then don&#146;t leave me!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I&#146;ve got to give my
marriage another chance.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No you don&#146;t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce
another chance.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (standing up) I&#146;m sorry. (hugs him)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohhh. Don&#146;t go.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn&#146;t
let her go.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. No! No! No!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Honey, honey, people are looking.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I
don&#146;t care!!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Yeah, um, I&#146;m, I&#146;m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of
Chandler&#146;s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can&#146;t leave! I have your shoe!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Rachel has those in burgendy.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are holding the
giant poking device.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be
difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Can we please focus here, a naked man&#146;s life hangs in the balance!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m telling you he&#146;s dead. What we are about to have here is a
dead fat guy on a stick.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, ladies and gentlemen, let&#146;s poke. (they start to advance
the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.
Okay, okay, we&#146;re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their
view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the
needle. </p>

<p>(They thread the needle and start poking him, he then stirs.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He&#146;s alive! He&#146;s a-live!!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And yet, we&#146;re still poking him.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, retract the device, retract the device.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He does not look happy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey-hey, now he&#146;s showing us his poking device.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, that&#146;s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!</p>

watching football, the girls are cooking Thanksgiving dinner.]</p>

<p><b>The Guys:</b> (reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, it&#146;s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching
football, you could help.</p>

<p><b>The Guys:</b> We will. (they don&#146;t move)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No Mon, <b>you</b> want to put them in concentric circles. <b>I</b> want
to do this. </p>

<p>(Rachel sticks a marshmellow into Monica&#146;s nose. Monica takes it out of her nose
by closing one nostril, and blowing.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Every year.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these
things. (just as she sits down).</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Halftime.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little
three on three going?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! That would be sooo much fun!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, can I play too? I&#146;ve never played football, like ever. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Great, you can cover Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, no, I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t really wanna play.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut
clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don&#146;t say that I
don&#146;t have goals!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you
get some fresh air, maybe it&#146;ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don&#146;t
play, everyone will be mad at you &#145;cause the teams won&#146;t be even. Come on.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, all right, I&#146;ll play.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yay!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let&#146;s do it! Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you wanna play football?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, Monica and I aren&#146;t supposed to play football.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Says who? Your mom?</p>

<p><b>Monica and Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football
game called the &#145;Geller Bowl.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, no, you say that proudly.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind&#146;ve
competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross&#146;s nose.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It was soo <b>not</b> an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she
threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> To score the winning touchdown, by the way.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown
didn&#146;t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose
breaking.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah! Then how come you didn&#146;t get the Geller Cup?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, there was a Geller Cup?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,
&#145;nobody won that game, &#145; and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy
and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it
in the lake.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And was the curse lifted?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Anyway. That&#146;s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever
again.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it&#146;s
been twelve years.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Can I see you for a second?</p>

<p>(they walk over to the sink and discuss it for a moment)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (shouting) Once!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, we&#146;re gonna play.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because
my Mom won&#146;t let me cross the street.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Park, the gang is warming up for their football game.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Let&#146;s bring it in.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Here you go. (throws her the ball)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the
face.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, we have to pick captains.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And then Tineals.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, so how do we decide that?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, why don&#146;t we just bunny up.</p>

<p><b>Rachel, Chandler, and Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica and Ross:</b> (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit
ears with their fingers.) Bunny!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first
so that means I get to pick first. Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, I&#146;m your best friend.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sweetie, don&#146;t worry you&#146;ll get picked. Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe.</p>

<p>(Phoebe kisses Rachel on the cheek, then joins her team.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sweetie, now I pick you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You don&#146;t <b>pick</b> me! You&#146;re <b>stuck</b> with me!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. All right. So let&#146;s see, let&#146;s play from the trash can, to
the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we&#146;ll kick off.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right people listen, I&#146;ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes
before I have to baste again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow! Just like in the pros.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Huddle up.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, Phoebe you know what you&#146;re doing right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, Joey&#146;s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What&#146;s block?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you&#146;re doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I thought you meant in life.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Break.</p>

<p>(Chandler is getting ready to kick off, Ross is holding the ball between his foot and
finger.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but
kicks Ross&#146;s foot instead.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry. I&#146;m sorry. Y'know what, we&#146;re just gonna throw it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Go! Go! Go!</p>

<p>(Joey runs up field and fakes out Ross and scores a touchdown. His team all celebrates
the touchdown.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Score!! 7 to nothing!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, let&#146;s go!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Losers walk!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, losers talk!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.</p>

<p>[cut to later, Ross&#146;s team has the ball.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts
his hands between Ross&#146;s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and
looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (from the shotgun) Hike!</p>

<p><b>Monica and Joey:</b> One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.</p>

<p>(Rachel runs a quick slant.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Over here!</p>

<p>(Chandler throws her the ball, which she drops.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the
right. Okay. Break!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait, what am I gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You, you go long.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait, how long?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Until we start to look very small.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Break!!</p>

<p>[cut to later, Monica&#146;s team has the ball.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Set....hike!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, no, no, no!</p>

<p>(Monica throws the ball over Joey&#146;s head, it&#146;s stopped from rolling away by a
very beautiful woman.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on guys! Let&#146;s go! Come on, it&#146;s second down.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, hello, it&#146;s third down.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No it&#146;s not, it&#146;s second.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Pulling what? It&#146;s second down.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, it&#146;s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you
need.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I heard that!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I said it loud.</p>

<p>[cut to Chandler, Joey, and Margha.]</p>

<p><b>Margha:</b> It is okay, if I stay and watch?</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Yeah! Why don&#146;t you stick around. You can sit right
there.</p>

<p>(she goes and sits down)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that went well.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it
myself, y'know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of
that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I&#146;ll let you have
her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn&#146;t
I wouldn&#146;t have a shot?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well I don&#146;t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don&#146;t feel bad
man, we all have our strengths. You&#146;re better with numbers and stuff.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Math!! You&#146;re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget
about it, you go for the girl, we&#146;ll see who gets her.</p>

<p>[cut to later, in Ross&#146;s huddle.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And
sweetie..</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it&#146;s like all I&#146;m doing is
running back and forth from the huddle.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Can I see that for second.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>(Rachel takes the ball from his hands and bounces it off of Ross&#146;s forehead and
Chandler catches the rebound.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Hut! Hike!</p>

<p>(Chandler runs around behind Ross, who pitches him the ball. Chandler runs upfield, and
Joey knocks the ball out of his hands.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Fumble!</p>

<p>(Joey starts to return the fumble and Chandler grabs Joey&#146;s shirt and rips it off
of his back.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What the hell&#146;s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, that&#146;s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But
now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! Well, I&#146;ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or
something about you that&#146;s mean!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, come on guys, let&#146;s go! Tie score, and we&#146;re
runnin&#146; out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica
throws the ball to Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs, run!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Run, Phoebe, run!</p>

<p>(Phoebe runs and scores a touchdown.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Touchdown!! Touchdown!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn&#146;t count.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> After the snap!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Before the snap!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> After!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Before!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Now, does it really matter?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yes!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh Pheebs, that&#146;s great. It doesn&#146;t count.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Does so count!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what, that&#146;s fine, maybe you haven&#146;t grown up, but I
have.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-ho, okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go
ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Woo-yay!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Listen, I&#146;m not gonna go through this with you again, okay.
Just once I wanna beat when you can&#146;t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the
fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let&#146;s just call this, tie score and
it&#146;s halftime.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, first of all, I don&#146;t play with cheaters, and second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what? I&#146;ll think you&#146;ll play.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh really! Why is that?</p>

<p>[cut to Monica and Rachel&#146;s.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because the winner gets this!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The Geller Cup.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, good.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The park, the gang is returning to play the second half of the game.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I
swam into the lake and fished it out.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That cup is mine!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No it&#146;s not! You want it, you&#146;re gonna have to win it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, so are we not having dinner at all?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on Phoebe, let&#146;s go! Come on, it&#146;s time to get serious,
huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able
to focus?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I&#146;ll
take care of the rest.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Break!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Here you go!</p>

<p>(Joey throws the ball to Chandler)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler! Chandler!</p>

<p>(Chandler catches the ball and starts to run upfield.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Margha) Hi.</p>

<p>(just as he gets in front of Margha, Monica comes up and tackles him)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don&#146;t see that everyday, do
ya?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What&#146;s with the tackling?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! I just touched him and he went over.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.</p>

<p>(They both stare each other down as we hear &#145;Let&#146;s get ready to
r-r-r-rum-ble!!!&#146;)</p>

<p>(A long football sequence follows.)</p>

<p>[Sequence 1: Monica throws the ball over Chandler&#146;s head to Joey who catches it
for a touchdown, and starts to dance in celebration. Chandler then tackles him, and he
starts to dance in celebration.]</p>

<p>[Sequence 2: Monica runs upfield and stops, waiting for a pass. Ross runs over and
pulls her pants down, steps in front of her and intercepts the pass.]</p>

<p>[Sequence 3: Chandler throws a pass to Ross, who catches it. Phoebe starts screaming
and runs up to him and tries to tackle him. But all she ends up doing is running around
his waist and screaming.]</p>

<p>[Sequence 4: Ross hikes the ball to Chandler, and the camera pans down to show Rachel
standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum. Something hits her on the head and
she looks up to see where it came from.]</p>

<p>[Sequence 5: Monica hands the ball off to Phoebe, who runs up field and delivers a
fore-arm shiver to Chandler, knocking him over and scores the touchdown, and she yells...]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I love this game!!</p>

<p>[cut to Ross who walks up to Rachel who is eating a baked pretzel.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, where&#146;d you get that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I went really long.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s no surprise that your winning, &#145;cause you got to pick
first, so you got the better team.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You&#146;re so pathetic! Why can&#146;t you just accept it, we&#146;re
winning because I&#146;m better than you.</p>

<p>(Ross makes a &#145;Yeah. Right.&#146; sound.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I&#146;ll
prove it to you, okay. I&#146;ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I&#146;ll still win the
game.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! The guys against the girls? See, that&#146;s ridiculous Monica,
because I&#146;m only down by three touchdowns.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to
a bunch of girls.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you&#146;re with me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can not believe your trading me!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on Rach, come on. Let&#146;s see what&#146;s it like to be on a
winning team for a change.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are you gonna let me play?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right then.</p>

<p>[cut to the guys&#146; team.]</p>

<p><b>Margha:</b> (coming over) The game is over, we eat now?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no-no, the game&#146;s not over, we&#146;re just switching
teams.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it&#146;s better if we&#146;re
on the same team.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Right. Okay, let&#146;s play. Let&#146;s go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the
Netherlands, right?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.</p>

<p><b>Margha:</b> Oh, my.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let&#146;s play some ball,
guys.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I&#146;m not playing with this guy, now.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fine with me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, y'know what, let&#146;s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi,
which of my boys do you like?</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? </p>

<p><b>Margha:</b> Which do I like?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your
windmill...</p>

<p><b>Margha:</b> Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird,
I would have to say, Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn&#146;t understand the
question.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you don&#146;t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.</p>

<p><b>Margha:</b> I&#146;m sorry, Joey, that is my chose.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You hear that! That is her chose, mister I&#146;ll let you have her! I
win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)</p>

<p><b>Margha:</b> I&#146;m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wh-what?</p>

<p><b>Margha:</b> I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what, it doesn&#146;t matter, &#145;cause she picked me. Me!
From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching <i>Ready,
Set, Cook!</i></p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no
time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We&#146;re not gonna lose to girls.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! It&#146;s 42-21!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> This sucks, I was just up by that much!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.</p>

<p>[cut to the girls huddle.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just
think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while
you&#146;re making out...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let&#146;s kill
&#145;um!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!!! Kill &#145;um!!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how
are we gonna beat three boys?</p>

<p>(Another football sequence follows)</p>

<p>[Sequence 1: Chandler is running past Phoebe with the ball, Phoebe flashes him, he
stops and stares dumbfounded at her. Phoebe then runs up and takes the ball away.]</p>

<p>[Sequence 2: Phoebe throws the ball, and it&#146;s intercepted by Joey, who starts to
run up field. Rachel jumps on his back in order to try and tackle him, but she
doesn&#146;t slow him down. Monica and Phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop
Joey, who still manages to fight through the tackle and score the touchdown.]</p>

<p>[Sequence 3: Chandler is running with the ball, Phoebe flashes him again, but Chandler
covers his eyes, and keeps running. He then runs into a tree at the end of the field.]</p>

<p>[cut to the girls huddle]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we&#146;re down
by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a
slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Come on! Don&#146;t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, there&#146;s a reason.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> God, I&#146;m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you
let me throw, come on this is my game too.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I&#146;ll pitch it to you, you throw
it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you! Break!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!</p>

<p>(Phoebe snaps the ball to Monica, who pitches back to Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>The Guys:</b> One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!</p>

<p>(They all rush toward Rachel, who panics and runs away. She runs out of the park and up
along the fence, she then comes back into the park and runs past Monica, as she gets to
Monica, she throws the ball at Monica, and it hits her in the eye.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m so sorry! Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! I&#146;m not okay!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn&#146;t know
what to do.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on! Come on! Hurry! We&#146;re running out of time! Huddle up!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on the verge of tears) Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Break!</p>

<p>(In slow motion, Phoebe snaps the ball, Rachel goes long. Joey and Chandler and all
over Phoebe, leaving Rachel wide open. Ross starts to rush Monica, who sees Phoebe is
double covered, in desperation she throws to Rachel. We see flying through the air, and
then Rachel running underneath it, then the ball, then Rachel again, then the ball, then
Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey staring at it in shock. Then with the grace of Jerry Rice (no
offense to Jerry Rice), Rachel catches the ball, and she stops and spikes the ball. Both
Phoebe and Monica erupt in celebration.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at
that pole, so you&#146;re five feet short, so we win!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody
tagged Rachel, then isn&#146;t the play still going.</p>

<p>(they all start to dive for the ball and Monica and Ross grab it at the same time.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Let go! Let go!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Let go! I&#146;m a tiny little woman!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Guys! Guys! Come on! It&#146;s Thanksgiving, it&#146;s not important
who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not
you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ow!!</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey are eating Thanksgiving
dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there&#146;s a like
league we could join or something.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Isn&#146;t there a national football league.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> When they&#146;re hungry enough, they&#146;ll come in.</p>

<p>[Scene: The park, it&#146;s dark outside and Monica and Ross are still fighting over
the ball.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Let go!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! You let go!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How come it&#146;s always us left in the field holding the ball?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t know. I guess the other people just don&#146;t care enough.</p>

<p>(It starts snowing.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! It&#146;s starting to snow.</p>

<p>(They both look up, and watch it start to snow. Then they both start fighting for the
ball again.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still
be allowed to fly this thing?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks
getting trained by another waitress?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> (laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training
again, whenever.</p>

cookies, as Ross and Chandler come up the stairs.]</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> So that&#146;s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown
Birds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call,
then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird
flapping it&#146;s wings.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I was shrieking... like a Marine.</p>

<p>(they both start up the stairs.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right here. Watch me execute the three &#145;P&#146;s of championship
play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a
backswing and hits Sarah who&#146;s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both
watch in horror.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know. I feel horrible. Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on <i>Seasame

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I&#146;m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do
you think she&#146;ll like?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Maybe a <i>Hello Kitty</i> doll, the ability to walk...</p>

<p>(Rachel starts to laugh, and Ross notices her.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look out kids, he&#146;s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his
head down in shame.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Have fun. Oh wait, no, don&#146;t! I forgot I am totally against that
now.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Me having a job?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and
their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,
how do you sleep at night?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I&#146;m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,
Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their
fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?</p>

<p>(Phoebe turns and looks at Monica, while Joey frantically motions to Chandler to help
him out.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of
them, it&#146;s the only chance to see New York.</p>

empty trays on the back counter.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh. Well, y'know that&#146;s actually a really good idea, because that
way they&#146;ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses
do that too.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> They already do. That&#146;s why they call it the &#145;tray
spot.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it
was a club they went to. Oh God, I&#146;m, I&#146;m sorry. (walks away)</p>

<p>[Scene: Sarah&#146;s bedroom, her room is decorated with a space motif.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that
you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don&#146;t have to sell those
cookies anymore. </p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a <b>real</b> space shuttle.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments,
as I do daydreaming about outer space, he&#146;d be able to afford a trip to the Taj
Mahal.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the
way to India.</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he&#146;s
gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to
sell in order to win?</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> So far, I&#146;ve sold seventy-five.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his
wallet) How much are the boxes?</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> Five dollars a box.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> A ten speed bike. But, I&#146;d rather have something my Dad
couldn&#146;t sell.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, that makes sense.</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> Could you do me one favor, if it&#146;s not too much trouble?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, Sarah, anything.</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space
shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don&#146;t have a TV, the lady across the
alley said she&#146;d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.</p>

<p>[Scene: A hallway, Ross is selling Brown Bird cookies for Sarah, he stops and knocks on
a door.]</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> (looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.)
Yesss?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi, I&#146;m selling Brown Bird cookies.</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> You&#146;re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, hi, I&#146;m, I&#146;m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird
salute.)</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> What does that mean?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I&#146;m not invited to
sleep-overs.</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, please, please, um, it&#146;s for a poor little girl who wants to go
to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> I&#146;m pressing, a policeman is on his way.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay! I&#146;m going. I&#146;m going. (goes across the hall to knock
on another door.)</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> I can still see you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey&#146;s work, selling Christmas trees.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (walking up to Joey) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey. What, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,
all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Destiny.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (One of Joey&#146;s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!
That one doesn&#146;t look very fulfilled.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, that&#146;s, that&#146;s ah, one of the old ones, he&#146;s just
taking it to the back.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, what happens to the old guys?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, they go into the chipper.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why, do I have a feeling that&#146;s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey
points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play
in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against
Joey&#146;s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the &#145;cut
it&#146; motion with his hands)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, all except Phoebe are there, Ross is telling the gang, minus
Rachel who&#146;s still being retrained, about the different cookie options.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,
Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I&#146;ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus&#146;s.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I&#146;m trying to send a little girl to
Spacecamp, I&#146;m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, but ah, there&#146;s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you
what, I&#146;ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.</p>

<p>(Chandler mouths &#145;Okay.&#146;)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mon?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, I&#146;ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and
that&#146;s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)
Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, no Mon, Dad <b>had</b> to buy everyone of your boxes <b>because</b>
you ate them all. But ah, y'know I&#146;m sure that&#146;s not gonna happen this time, why
don&#146;t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the
Rudolph&#146;s.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, come on, now you know you want &#145;em.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Don&#146;t, don&#146;t, don&#146;t, don&#146;t, don&#146;t do this.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;ll tell you what Mon, I&#146;ll give you the first box for free.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! All the cool kids are eating &#145;em! (chases after her.)</p>

<p>[cut to Gunther retraining Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don&#146;t
just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sitting down next to Chandler) I&#146;m training to be better at a job
that I hate, my life officially sucks.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look Rach, wasn&#146;t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you
wanted to do fashion stuff?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, yeah! I&#146;m still pursuing that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out
resumes like what, two years ago?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I&#146;m also sending out.... good thoughts.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you&#146;ve got nothing
pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> The fear?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He&#146;s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go
after a job you really want.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well then how come you&#146;re still at a job that you hate, I mean why
don&#146;t you quit and get &#145;the fear&#146;?</p>

<p>(Chandler and Joey both laugh)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because, I&#146;m too afraid.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,
y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don&#146;t want to be 30 and still work here.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, that&#146;d be much worse than being 28, and <b>still</b>
working here.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Can&#146;t I just look at the handles on them?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> You would think.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know
why I&#146;m a terrible waitress? Because, I don&#146;t care. I don&#146;t care. I
don&#146;t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don&#146;t care where the
tray spot is, I just don&#146;t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don&#146;t think
I should do it anymore. I&#146;m gonna give you my weeks notice.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Gunther, I quit.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) Does this mean we&#146;re gonna have to start paying for
coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is entering numbers on a calculator as Ross reads
off how much he&#146;s sold.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I spelled out boobies.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (comes up and starts looking through Ross&#146;s cookie supply) Ross,
but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint
treasures?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, we&#146;re out. I sold them all.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica, I&#146;m cutting you off.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it&#146;s no big
deal, all right, I&#146;m-I&#146;m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, how many have you sold so far?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God, how did you do that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as &#145;Laser
Floyd&#146; was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!
That&#146;s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, &#145;the munchies.&#146; So I
ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They
call me: 'Cookie Dude!'</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Okay, stop what you&#146;re doing, I need envelope stuffers,
I need stamp lickers.....</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Me! On my computer.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well you sure used a large font.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad
co-captain only took up so much room.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey-hey-hey that&#146;s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!
You wanna know what else is really funny?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Something else I might have said?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know, I don&#146;t know, weren&#146;t you the guy that told
me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sweetie, calm down, it&#146;s gonna be okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it&#146;s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I
don&#146;t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I&#146;m just gonna, I&#146;m just gonna call
Gunther and I&#146;m gonna tell him, I&#146;m not quitting.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You-you-you don&#146;t wanna give into the fear.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and
your fear.... </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have
an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Not a problem.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And now for the great news.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, that wasn&#146;t the great news?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Only if you think it&#146;s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can)
snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind
of Christmas lookie.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Christmas cookie?</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey work, Joey is showing a guy a tree.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it&#146;s a little more
money, but you get a nicer smell.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Looks good. I&#146;ll take it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you
don&#146;t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead
tree she has)</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> It&#146;s-it&#146;s-it&#146;s almost dead!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay but that&#146;s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it&#146;s
Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, the ah, trees that don&#146;t fulfil their Christmas destiny are
thrown in the chipper.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> I-I think I&#146;m gonna look around a little bit more.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey, guys. I&#146;m here to pick out my Christmas tree.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one&#146;s yours!
Ahhh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is this the one that I threw out last year?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one!
I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m sorry, I didn&#146;t mean to get so emotional, I guess it&#146;s
just the holidays, it&#146;s hard.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh honey, is that &#145;cause your Mom died around Christmas?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I wasn&#146;t even thinking about that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a &#145;way-to-go&#146; thumbs
up and smile.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A Brown Bird meeting, Ross is there with the other Brown Birds to see who won
the contest.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you
sell?</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> I&#146;m not gonna tell you! You&#146;re the bad man who broke
Sarah&#146;s leg.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey now! That was an accident, okay.</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> You&#146;re a big scrud.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What&#146;s a scrud?</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Why don&#146;t you look in the mirror, scrud.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t have too. I can just look at you.</p>

<p><b>Leader:</b> All right girls, and man. Let&#146;s see your final tallies. (all the
girls raise their hands) Ohhhh, Debbie, (looks at her form) 321 boxes of cookies, (to
Debbie) Very nice.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to himself) Not nice enough.</p>

<p><b>Leader:</b> Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to himself) Good for a scrud.</p>

<p><b>Leader:</b> Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the
salute)</p>

<p><b>Leader:</b> Who&#146;s next? (goes over and stands behind Ross, who&#146;s
feverishly writing on his form, and clears her throat to get his attention.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi there!</p>

<p><b>Leader:</b> Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you
bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious....
nuget.... diffency.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross are there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old
sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Rachel, who&#146;s entering) Hey! How&#146;d the interview go?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I blew it. I wouldn&#146;t of even hired me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you&#146;re gonna go on like a thousand
interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That&#146;s not how that was supposed
to come out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is the worst Christmas ever.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the
coffee house.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can&#146;t! It&#146;s too late! Terry already hired that girl over
there. (points to her) Look at her, she&#146;s even got waitress experience. Last night
she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That word was swans.</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments, Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are
coming up the stairs.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my
Christmas.</p>

<p>(They start to go into Monica and Rachel&#146;s, their apartment is filled with all of
the old Christmas trees from Joey&#146;s work.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Joey and Monica:</b> (jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you&#146;re the best!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s like &#145;Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.&#146;</p>

<p>(phone rings)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh!
You&#146;re kidding! You&#146;re kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure, everybody loves a kidder.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (hanging up the phone) I got the job!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> That&#146;s great! Hey! Excellent!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, God bless us, everyone.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is serving her last cup of coffee.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Here we go. I&#146;m serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts
humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I
ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it&#146;s
just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room)
Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it
feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s new job, Rachel&#146;s boss is telling her what to do.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel&#146;s Boss:</b> Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna
use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, &#145;cause this part&#146;s tricky,
see some people use filters just once.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, Ross is bringing Sarah to Joey and
Chandler&#146;s.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m, I&#146;m sorry you didn&#146;t get to go to Spacecamp, and
I&#146;m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah
Tuttle&#146;s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump
up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in
tinfoil.)</p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> Really Mr. Geller, you don&#146;t have to do this.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by
for mission countdown!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (simulating an echo) <b>Ten</b>, ten.., <b>nine</b>, nine, nine....,
eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!</p>

<p>(They start shaking the chair likes it&#146;s flying into outer space. Ross picks up a
soccer ball and starts spinning it in his hand and runs around the chair beeping like a
satellite. Chandler also starts running around the chair and saying...)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m an alien. I&#146;m an alien.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey&#146;s
head.)</p>

<p>(The camera zooms in on Sarah and she has a big smile on her face.)</p>

there, Joey is demonstrating a card trick.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize
it. Show to everybody. Got it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Um-mm.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the
card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a
little while) 5 of hearts.</p>

<p>(Monica is sarcastically amazed.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Real magic does exist.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can&#146;t tell you that, no.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, somebody&#146;s at the door on the ceiling.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo, that&#146;s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why don&#146;t you go up there and ask him to &#145;step lightly,
please?&#146;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there
to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I&#146;ll go up there, I&#146;ll tell him
to keep it down.</p>

<p>(Phoebe exits)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna
know how I did it, I&#146;ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you
didn&#146;t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks
up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again.
Here, I&#146;ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow
motion)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh, I got it.</p>

<p>(We hear Phoebe knock at the door upstairs, and the guy answer it.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs
and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the
rest is unintelligible).</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> (muffled) Whoa, you are very beautiful.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (muffled) Oh, thank you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with
a little nouse at the end?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, what&#146;s the matter?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I just saw Janice. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she
looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid&#146;s pretzel at them.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke
up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed
me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Chandler, there&#146;s a party tomorrow, you&#146;ll feel better then.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, y'know what, I&#146;m gonna be okay, you don&#146;t have to throw
a party for me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s Joey&#146;s birthday.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.</p>

<p>(We hear Phoebe&#146;s muffled voice through the ceiling.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.</p>

<p>(We hear the guy telling a joke, and Phoebe laughing.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it&#146;s
supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.</p>

<p>[Scene: Fortunata Fashions, Rachel&#146;s new job.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Kaplan:</b> (entering) How&#146;s that coffee comin,&#146; dear?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Kaplan:</b> I&#146;m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Kaplan:</b> I&#146;ll bet your thinking, &#145;What&#146;s an intelligent girl
who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?&#146; Eh?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Op.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Kaplan:</b> Eh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you got me.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Kaplan:</b> Well, don&#146;t think I haven&#146;t noticed your potential. Well,
I&#146;ve got a project for you that&#146;s a lot more related to fashion. How does that
sound?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, that sounds great.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Kaplan:</b> Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Kaplan:</b> (opening the closet door revealing that it&#146;s full of tangled up
hangers.) I need these hangers separated ASAP. (she is stunned) You&#146;re welcome.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Moondance Diner, Rachel is talking to Monica about her job.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know honey, I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think
why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it&#146;s remotely
related to the field they&#146;re interested in.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (gives her a look) Gee, I don&#146;t know Rach. Order up!! I got a
Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh honey, come on, I&#146;m sorry, I didn&#146;t.... I don&#146;t mind
paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,
the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.</p>

<p>(A guy at the end of the table starts laughing.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> I&#146;m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... (starts to laugh again)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&#146;s not funny, this is actually my job.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Oh believe me, I-I-I&#146;ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at
that Mannequins Plus.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh well then, so I&#146;m just going to go back to talking to my friend
here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Ah, just one other thing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes?!</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> I ah, I work at <i>Bloomingdale&#146;s</i> and I might know of a job
possibility if your, if your interested?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it&#146;s Joey&#146;s party.]</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> (to Monica and Phoebe) Hey guys.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you&#146;re going out on a date with
the noisy guy upstairs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he&#146;s very charming.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know, he&#146;s too charming, but if you two start going out, then
it&#146;s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, you&#146;re just gonna have to try.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, where are the <em>Jell-o</em> shots?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin&#146; &#145;em
around...</p>

<p>(Camera cuts to show Chandler giving a Jello shot to the ceramic dog and holding an
empty tray of Jello shots.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello-dillillio!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, somebody&#146;s feeling better.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Monica) Take off your shirt!</p>

<p>(Chandler sticks out is tongue and it&#146;s a horrible shade of green.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, <em>Jell-o</em> just like Mom used to make.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! So I&#146;m out having lunch at Monica&#146;s and this guy starts
talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at <i>Bloomingdale&#146;s</i> and
there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and
he&#146;s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And he&#146;s, he&#146;s a total stranger?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What!?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I&#146;m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop
in out of nowhere for no reason.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> To be nice.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, only for sex.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about
me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I didn&#146;t have to, because I was wearing my &#145;I heart Ross&#146;
sandwich board and ringing my bell.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Sisters:</b> (entering) Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! (all 7 of them look
almost identical)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey&#146;s sisters.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi Joey&#146;s sisters!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Cookie:</b> Hey. What are we drinkin&#146; over here.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.</p>

<p><b>Cookie:</b> No kiddin,&#146; that&#146;s the exact same drink I made myself right
after I shot my husband.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow. Okay, I don&#146;t know how to talk to you.</p>

<p>(Cut to Chandler)</p>

<p><b>Sister 1:</b> (to Chandler) What &#145;cha doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I&#146;m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Sisters:</b> Oh!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no-no, no, it&#146;s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily
anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can&#146;t we savor the precious moments? (to
one of Joey&#146;s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.</p>

<p>(Cut to Ross and Monica)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Isn&#146;t that great?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good
guy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I
actually used the phrase, &#145;Hummina-hummina-hummina.&#146; (walks away)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s excellent.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel) So, he&#146;s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark
doesn&#146;t want anything in exchange for helping him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I assume I&#146;ll have to take showers with him, but y'know,
that&#146;s true of any job.</p>

<p>(Chandler enters hungover and groaning)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How ya feelin&#146;?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, my apartment isn&#146;t there anymore, because I drank it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Where&#146;d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the
presents.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Woooo hoooo!!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ow, no &#145;woo-hooing,&#146; no &#145;woo-hooing.&#146; </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why, what happened?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, I fooled around with Joey&#146;s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,
that&#146;s not the worst part. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is the worse part?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&#146;t remember which sister.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel) You see what men do! Don&#146;t tell me men are not nice!
(points to Chandler) This is men!!</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he&#146;s actually
going to kill you dead.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay! You don&#146;t think I thought of that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How can you not know which one?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean that&#146;s unbelievable.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean, was it Gina?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Which one is Gina?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, no, no, that&#146;s Dina.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Monica) You see you can&#146;t tell which one is which either,
dwha!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We didn&#146;t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Veronica. Look, it&#146;s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red
skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That was me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, when I&#146;ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly
friendly, and I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s all right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, Joey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why can&#146;t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I just got off the phone with my sister.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, which, which one?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Mary-Angela.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mary-Angela.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know which one was she again?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why don&#146;t you ask Chandler, &#145;cause he&#146;s the one that fooled
around with her. She told me you said you could really <b>fall</b> for her. Now is that
true? Or are you just gettin&#146; over Janice by groping my sister. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s gotta be the first one.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really? That&#146;s great! You and my sister, sittin&#146; in a tree.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yep, I&#146;m in a tree.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No honey, I&#146;m sorry, but the weekend&#146;s not over yet.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that
Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I guess they&#146;re back from their date.</p>

<p>(He starts to play music.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Music. Very nice.</p>

<p>(We hear them start making out upstairs.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, how are you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I am good. I finished my book.</p>

<p>(Things start to get really hot upstairs.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah, what&#146;s it about?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I do. (they both run out)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross is reading a letter that Chandler wrote.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How&#146;s it going. This is the hardest letter
I&#146;ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell&#146;s a matter with you? How do
you think Joey&#146;s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a
letter?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that&#146;s the part where you tell him that I moved to France.
When actually I&#146;ll be in Cuba.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, look, look, you&#146;ve got to do this yourself, okay in
person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,
okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her
down easy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Where in Cuba?</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey&#146;s sister&#146;s house, Chandler hits himself on the head three times
and knocks on the door three times. Joey answers it.]</p>

here?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m here to see Mary-Angela.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,
listen, listen, you got to be cool, &#145;cause my Grandma doesn&#146;t know about you two
yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on
Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where&#146;s Mary-Angela?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She&#146;s right in there. (motions to the living room)</p>

red.)</p>

he didn&#146;t call.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Bummer.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you&#146;re practically giddy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I&#146;m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn&#146;t work out. Look,
Rach, I want only good things for you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute, why don&#146;t you just call Mark. (they both look up in
shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you&#146;ve got to make
stuff happen.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But, you, you don&#146;t want to seem too pushy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Ross) Honey, it&#146;s not pushy, he gave her his home number.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As
in like, to, to his home?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, and you don&#146;t mind if I call, because you only want good
things for me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at
Monica)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it&#146;s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no,
don&#146;t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I&#146;ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my
number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That is so made up!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it&#146;s perfect. Oh
God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yay!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There you go.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that is amazing!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I&#146;d expect nothing less.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I got to figure out what I&#146;m going to wear.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> High collar and baggy pants say I&#146;m a pro.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Right! Okay, I&#146;ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo
hoo!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You go get &#145;em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in
some way?</p>

remove the boyfriend!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy
is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! Ross y'know this isn&#146;t even about you! I mean this is about
Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you&#146;re
right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean don&#146;t you trust her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Then get over yourself! Grow up!</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Grandmother:</b> Of course! It&#146;s her favorite.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So um, Mary-Angela, what&#146;s your second favorite?</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Grandmother:</b> More of Grandma&#146;s teramisu.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Would you just please....give me the receipt &#145;cause this is
great. It&#146;s top notch.</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Grandmother:</b> That dies with me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So will I.</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Sister:</b> Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn&#146;t mean anything.</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Sister:</b> (whispering in his ear) Just do it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)</p>

<p>[Cut to the hall, Joey&#146;s sister runs up and grabs Chandler&#146;s butt.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (startled) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Sister:</b> Finally, I thought we&#146;d never be alone. Can I just tell
you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he
ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I&#146;m not really in
a, in a commitment kind of place.</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Sister:</b> So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the
softest lips.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahhhh, you&#146;re not Mary-Angela.</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Sister:</b> No, I&#146;m Mary-Theresa.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This is so bad. If-if you&#146;re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?</p>

<p><b>Mary-Angela:</b> (standing behind Chandler) I am!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn&#146;t see Mary-Angela)</p>

<p><b>Mary-Angela:</b> Joey!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What&#146;s goin&#146; on?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pats him on the shoulder) You&#146;re it! Now run and hide!</p>

<p><b>Mary-Theresa:</b> It&#146;s no big deal. Chandler was just kissin&#146; me because
he thought I was Mary-Angela.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I wasn&#146;t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey&#146;s
sisters gasp) Look, I&#146;m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really
similar.</p>

<p><b>Joey&#146;s Sister:</b> I say, punch him Joey.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! Punch him!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother&#146;s not
going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you&#146;d
be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want
you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you&#146;re my best
friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.</p>

<p><b>Cookie:</b> So what. I say, punch him.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! No! No! No, I&#146;m not going to punch Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Cookie:</b> I&#146;ll do it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No you won&#146;t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe
him, he&#146;s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you&#146;ve got one more apology to make, all
right, you&#146;ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, absolutely!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&#146;ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister&#146;s, but he
still doesn&#146;t know which one is Mary-Angela.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Cookie, now you can punch him!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?! (Cookie punches him)</p>

<p>[Scene: A lobby, Ross is waiting for Rachel, after her interview.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)
</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi. (kisses her)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How&#146;d did it go?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank
God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy
and wouldn&#146;t shut up.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m so proud of you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Me too!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen, I&#146;m ah, I&#146;m sorry I&#146;ve been so crazy and jealous
and, it&#146;s just that I like you a lot, so...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the
job.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I did!</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, The entire gang is there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh well y'know. (laughs)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I do know.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ick, you were eavesdropping.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I&#146;m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really
happens to like me.</p>

<p>(We hear the sound of a bed creaking through the ceiling, and him moaning.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Maybe he&#146;s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?</p>

<p>(We hear a women start moaning.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, that&#146;s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy
is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)
But, is he a big guy?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, we&#146;ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks you guys! Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Don&#146;t worry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God, I hope they kick his ass!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know if it&#146;s any consolation, he really did sound like he was
having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)</p>

<p>(We the guys knock on the door upstairs, and the guy answering it.)</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> (muffled) May I help you?</p>

<p>(We hear the guys start to attack him, but the guy manages to calm them down and gets
them to agree to what he did. Monica throws up her hands in disgust.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting ready for her first day.] </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does
everybody hate these shoes? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that
as long as your wearing that towel dress. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross) Tell him. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to
start with her! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert,
y'know he's the botanist. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound) </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach,
I'm here with the purses! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down
there and I'll take you out to lunch? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to
Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the
bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can
see a stripper. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a
magician?! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all
right. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b> </p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are entering, Joey is on the phone.] </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should
of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really
good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!
(pause) Don't cry outloud. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway
musical? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It is me! It's a musical version of <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>. So I think
I'm gonna sing <i>New York, New York</i>, and ah, oh <i>I left My Heart in San Francisco</i>.
</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'll get you the Cliff Notes. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> The what? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi honey! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, he's just goofing around. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in
his own office? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two
assistants. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.

back turned to him she removes her fake breasts and hides them under her wig.] </p>

<p><b>Jeannine:</b> (to Monica) All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can
be alone with him. You'd better go for it. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Please, I'm not going for anything. </p>

<p><b>Jeannine:</b> Well, if you don't, I will. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Would you please go? </p>

<p><b>Jeannine:</b> Night Mon. Night Julio. </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> (to Jeannine) Adios. </p>

<p>(Monica starts wiping down the stools, as Julio follows along behind her replacing the
napkin holders.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look Julio, someone left their book here. </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> Ah actually, that is mine. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yeah, what are you reading? </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it? </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> I thought I would, but the translation's no good. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I
can't believe I just said that.') </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> Actually I ah, I am a poet. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write
about? </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this
lip. (points to her lip) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here? </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> I can write an epic poem about this lip. (grabs her lower lip) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. </p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's audition.] </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a
handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two.......... </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Lovely, just lovely. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really? Thanks. </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on
Saturday. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Excellent, I'll be there. </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance
audition. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it <b>wasn't</b> a dancing part. </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your
dance background it'll be a piece of cake. </p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is reading Joey's resume.] </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the
American Ballet Theater?! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids
either. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, can you dance at all? </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no, no, no, no. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that? </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. </p>

<p>(phone rings) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello?
(listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that
you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?
(listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hi! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even
sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to
write a poem. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am
like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
(hands them the poem) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
(tries to take the poem) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, I'm not done. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye-bye. </p>

<p>(Monica leaves) </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What, what, what?! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My
vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You really think that is what he meant? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Done. </p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel's office, her desk is covered with stuff Ross has sent her.] </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> (reaching through the flowers) Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play
the theme from Love Story) </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Wh-what's that? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's from Ross, it's a love bug. </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's
just really romantic. </p>

<p><b>Man:</b> (to Rachel) Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Man:</b> (being joined by the rest of the barbershop quartet) One, two, three... </p>

<p><b>Quartet:</b> (singing) Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It

<p><b>The Bass Barber:</b> It's nice to have a boyfriend. </p>

<p><b>Quartet:</b> Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross! </p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b> </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are entering the living room from her
bedroom.] </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you
any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right Ross!! I get it!! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I mean my God... </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You're hurt! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office
anymorrrrre!! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your
territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I would never do that! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He
said this is what you guys do. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot. </p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, Joey are there.] </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Mark's a genius! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why?! How?! How is he a genius? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her
right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to
complain about you. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What am I going to do? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did
that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few
surprise visits. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know you guys. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us,
meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she
starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And
he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be
like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And
we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He paints quite a picture doesn't he? </p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel's office.] </p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> (walking up to Mark) Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December. </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> (turning around) And wait, I've got something for you. (kisses her) </p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Mark!! </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> It's okay, Rachel knows. </p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Yeah, but even soo. </p>

<p>(Ross appears in the hallway just outside of Rachel's office.) </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee) </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just
so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on
no one's around, just, just kiss me. </p>

<p>(They start to kiss, and Ross rushes into the office to break it up.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> What is going on? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (now standing behind Ross) Ross! </p>

<p>(Ross finally looks at the woman kissing Mark.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand
on her shoulder and she knocks it away.) </p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's dance audition, Joey is warming up.] </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a
call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long
Island. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So, does that mean the audition is off? </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to
take these dancers and show them the combination. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, (very
quickly, Joey watches stunned) up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand
sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Have fun. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Bye. (does the jazz hands) </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is tying a ribbon to a vase.] </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you wrapping? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh-ho, look what I got Julio. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, it's a vase. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, just like the one in the poem. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well not exactly like the one in the poem. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What do you mean? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)
</p>

<p>[Scene: The Moondance Diner.] </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> What? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't
write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my <i>People</i> magazine
comes on Saturday, and the new <i>Hold Everything</i> catalog. Y'know but that does not
mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no
right to make that kind of judgment about me. </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You don't even know me... </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What? </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you
would think this. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... </p>

<p><b>Julio:</b> No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (sarcastically) Oh yeah. </p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's audition, the director has returned and wants to see the combination.] </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> All right, let's do it! </p>

<p>(The group does the same horrible dance that Joey did earlier in the show, except
they're all out of sync and they do the jazz hands at the end.) </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> No, no, no. What was that? </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know, it was the best I could get out of them. </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Well, people! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> People, people, people. </p>

<p><b>Director:</b> Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.
(to Joey) Show 'em how it's done. (to the pianist) Count it off. </p>

<p>(The pianist starts to play, and Joey readies himself, and then runs out of the
audition.) </p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Rachel are there.] </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See,
she's fully dressed, right? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you
click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street,
she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just
stares at him.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hi. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> A big idiot. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda
hard for me. </p>

<p>(Gunther is eavesdropping in the background.) </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if
it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not
gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. </p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Let it be me! Let it be me! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people
love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she
kisses him) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you
pick me up some porn? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Where ya going? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, with who? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You have a play date with a stripper?! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing.
And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree
class. Why, is that okay? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure, is she married? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ahh, no. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you jealous? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I
mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You are totally jealous. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain
things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Honey, I love you too. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? </p>

<p>(She runs over and gives him a very passionate kiss.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of
hours, y'know. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a
stripper. </p>

<p><b>Man:</b> (singing) Mister Pretensous, (Monica stands up in the background) you think
there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner. </p>

<p><b>Quartet:</b> Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to clerk) Hi.</p>

<p>(The clerk enters the video into the computer.)</p>

<p><b>Clerk:</b> Six dollars, please.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Six? I just had it for one night. It&#146;s three.</p>

<p><b>Clerk:</b> Eight o&#146;clock is the cut-off and, (looks at his watch) aww,
it&#146;s 8:02.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you&#146;re gonna
have to help me out here, &#145;cause I only have three.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> (standing behind her, without his moustache) I can help with that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> So, you look great.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> No you do. You... just...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> You&#146;ve got panties stuck to your leg.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (removes them) That&#146;s because I-I was just grabbing some things out
of the dryer, and it&#146;s static cling. Or maybe it&#146;s just that God knew I&#146;d
be running into you and saw an opportunity.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> It&#146;s good to see you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s good to see you too.</p>

<p>(They hug, and Richard notices a stocking stuck to Monica&#146;s back, which he removes
for her.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You see that guy? He&#146;s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we
leave he&#146;s going straight to the porn.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> He&#146;s gonna go up to the counter with <i>Citizen Kane</i>, <i>Vertigo</i>,
and Clockwork Orgy. (they both laugh) This is nice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> I missed this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Me too.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, um, I don&#146;t know if that&#146;s a good idea.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Oh. Look, just friends, I won&#146;t grope you. I promise.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, I just I think that it&#146;s too soon.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> No it&#146;s not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No thanks. I&#146;m 29.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh sweetie, when do you think you&#146;re going to get off tonight?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh I don&#146;t know honey. It&#146;s gonna be really late.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh come on, not again.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know. I&#146;m sorry. Look, I&#146;ll make a deal with you all right?
Okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> For every night that you&#146;re asleep before I get home from work...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I will wake you up in a way that&#146;s proved very popular in the past.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like
y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that&#146;s he&#146;s
going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And what are you going to do for him?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m going to let him.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Cool.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her bedroom) Morning.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Somebody got in late last night.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah well, I ran into Richard. </p>

<p>(They all gasp)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> When did this happen?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we
went out for an innocent burger.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, there&#146;s no such thing as an innocent burger.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, are you gonna see him again?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Tomorrow night.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now
she&#146;s celebrating that by going on a date with him.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s not a date, okay. I&#146;m just gonna teach him how to make
lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you&#146;ll probably be
hungry after the sex.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We&#146;re not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing&#146;s changed here. He
still doesn&#146;t want children and I still do, so that&#146;s why we&#146;re just gonna
be friends.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Naked friends.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you have any ice?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Check the freezer. If there&#146;s none in there, then we&#146;re probably
out. Are you just getting in from work? It&#146;s late.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the
meeting with the reps from <i>Calvin Klien</i>. I told my boss I liked this line of
lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I discovered I&#146;m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of <i>The
Shining</i> in your freezer?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But ah, you&#146;re safe from it if it&#146;s in the freezer?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading <i>The Shining</i>,
without making sure we&#146;ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How often do you read it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Haven&#146;t you ever read the same book over and over again?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, umm, I guess I read <i>Little Women</i> more than once. But I mean
that&#146;s a classic, what&#146;s so great about <i>The Shining</i>?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> The question should be Rach, what is <b>not</b> so great about <i>The
Shining</i>. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest
book ever. I bet it&#146;s way better than that classic of yours.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Ah, well we&#146;ll just see about that, okay. I will read <i>The
Shining</i>, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn&#146;t want to let it
go) and you will read <i>Little Women</i>. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, you got it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Ross are there, Phoebe is entering with her date

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, hey.</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Robert) You&#146;ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek).
That&#146;s okay, it&#146;s mine, we just kissed.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Robert) So ah, isn&#146;t a bit cold out for shorts?</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Well, I&#146;m from California.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.</p>

<p>(Robert leans back on the arm of the chair and allows Chandler to see up his shorts and
sees &#145;little Robert.&#146; Chandler is horrified by this view.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (standing up) I&#146;m up! I&#146;m up, I&#146;ve gotten up now!
Anybody ah, want anything?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;ll have coffee.</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Yeah, me too.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, make that three.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay Ross, why don&#146;t you come with me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter
with you? What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Robert&#146;s coming out.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. He.....he&#146;s coming out of his shorts.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The man is showing brain.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you sure? (Chandler nods: Yes!) Hold on. (walks over behind the couch)
I&#146;m sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Coffee.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> We could write it down for you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, that won&#146;t be ah, that won&#146;t be necessary (leans down
and looks up Robert&#146;s shorts, seeing Robert&#146;s package.) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) Wellll?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What do we do? What do we do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Like an eclipse.</p>

<p>(Ross nods his head.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is teaching Richard how to make lasagne.]</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You say &#145;Thank you very much,&#146; and then you buy me something
pretty. Come on, we&#146;re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we&#146;re gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.</p>

<p>(They both start squishing the tomatoes.)</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Ew, this feels very weird.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You touch people&#146;s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish
them. (Monica grabs his hand in the tomatoes.) That&#146;s my hand.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oops.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Gotta keep squishing.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Tomatoes are squishing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(Richard squishes a little too hard and some lands on his shirt.)</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Op.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt. </p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it
should umm, be..... </p>

<p>(She is rubbing his chest and her voice trails off into silence, a long pause follows.)</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, you&#146;ve got some on your pants.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> I&#146;ll just throw them out.</p>

there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> These little women. Wow!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Your liking it, huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo&#146;s manuscript. I don&#146;t see how he
could ever forgive her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, Jo&#146;s a girl, it&#146;s short for Josephine.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But Jo&#146;s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean
it&#146;s like a girl-girl thing? &#145;Cause that is the one thing missing from <i>The
Shining</i>.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, actually Laurie&#146;s a boy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.</p>

<p>(Enter Phoebe and Robert)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! How&#146;d the ah, basketball go?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a
twenty-three pointer.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean a three pointer?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I get more because I&#146;m dainty.</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock. </p>

<p>(He puts his leg up on the couch to get the quarter, once again exposing himself to
Chandler and Ross. In horror, Chandler, slides over and leans against Joey on the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his
side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory)
Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, I&#146;m Joey, we haven&#146;t met.</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Ah, good to meet you. Robert.</p>

<p>(Robert walks away and the guys all start laughing in front of Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You
not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Calm down. There&#146;s no reason to get testy.</p>

<p>(The guys start laughing harder.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys!! Come on!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn&#146;t
as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Hey. (sits down)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Sure.</p>

<p>(He puts his leg up on the table to pass Joey the cookies, and Phoebe sees what the
guys are laughing at, and gasps.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, how&#146;d the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe
me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I&#146;ve been thinking a lot about you too.
(listens) I know. It&#146;s hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) It&#146;s a word!</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I do think it&#146;s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we&#146;re
being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I&#146;m sure.(she opens the door
and it&#146;s Richard)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So we can be friends who sleep together.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you
currently have any other racquetball buddies?</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Just your dad. (pause) Although that&#146;s actually racquetball. You
know I-I do have a blind date with my sister&#146;s neighbour next Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> You want me to cancel it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! (pushes him) No! </p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> &#145;Cause if you do that means you&#146;d be cancelling it for me, and

<p><b>Robert:</b> Oh! Wow! Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I
were you I would wear them every day, every day!</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I
don&#146;t think I can wear these, they&#146;re so tight, I feel like I&#146;m on display.
I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s all right, that&#146;s well, I figured.... (they start to
leave as Joey enters.)</p>

she&#146;s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the
hotel, and kills the dad.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Eh. Beth dies.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, Beth doesn&#146;t die, she doesn&#146;t die. Does she Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey&#146;s asking if you&#146;ve just ruined the first book he&#146;s
ever loved that didn&#146;t star Jack Nicholson?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. She doesn&#146;t die.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Then why would you say that?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because, I wanted to hurt you.</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> (running in) Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.</p>

<p>(He bends over to pick them up, right in front of Rachel, who then gets a free peep
show.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (gasps) Oh my....</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Got &#145;em.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is reading <i>The Shining</i>, as Monica enters.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I&#146;m
sorry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top
it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her
left breast.) in a grill fire.</p>

<p>(Rachel starts laughing.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you smiling at?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m sorry, I was just thinking you&#146;re day could still pick up.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, right.</p>

<p>(She goes into her bedroom, and sees Richard who has covered the room in roses and has
two glasses of wine and a rose between his lips.)</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I love this friend thing!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross are there.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Listen, Robert&#146;s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just
tell him?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Please, right now, no, every time I see him it&#146;s like &#145;Is it
on the lose?&#146; &#145;Is it watching me?&#146;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We can&#146;t tell him, you can&#146;t go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his.... stuff.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He&#146;s right, even if it&#146;s to say something complementary. (He
stops and thinks about what he just said.)</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> (entering) Hey! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> (to Phoebe) So are ready for the gym? They&#146;ve got this new rock
climbing wall, we can spot each other.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I can spot you from here.</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, listen Robert...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Chandler) Hey, don&#146;t we have to...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we got, um-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, I think you&#146;re really, really great...</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? (spreads
his legs) Is it something I&#146;m putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I-I-I-I don&#146;t know, I don&#146;t know what to say.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> (cleaning up the table) (to Robert) Hey buddy, this is a family place,
put the mouse back in the house.</p>

<p>(Robert looks down and realises the problem.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Richard&#146;s bedroom, Monica has covered it in rose pedals and candles. We
hear Richard come in to the apartment, and Monica frantically throws the rest of the
pedals on the bed, and jumps onto the bed and puts a rose in her mouth, and bites a
thorn.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ow!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> (outside the bedroom) Really?! Well, it&#146;s just like everyone
else&#146;s apartment. It&#146;s got rooms, walls, and ceilings.</p>

<p><b>Richard&#146;s Date:</b> Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me
the tour.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as
Richard starts the tour.)</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Ah well, this is the living room.</p>

<p><b>Richard&#146;s Date:</b> Impressive.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> All right. This is the kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Richard&#146;s Date:</b> Oh, that&#146;s real pretty. Wait a minute, don&#146;t I
get to see the bedroom?</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> The bedroom. Well it&#146;s pretty much your typical... (opens the door
as Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the
room.) bedroom.</p>

<p><b>Richard&#146;s Date:</b> We&#146;re still on this side of the door.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Um-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Richard&#146;s Date:</b> Yeah, but I didn&#146;t get to see it.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Oh shoot! Maybe next time. (yawns) Thanks for a lovely evening. (shows
her out)</p>

<p>[Cut to into the bedroom, with Monica still hiding under the covers. Richard enters and
sits down next to her.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Oh, (laughs) that was the blind date that I told you about, she called
and switched it to today.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I&#146;m just
asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Well, you seem fine.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I&#146;m not fine, I&#146;m not. I mean how
can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause)
Y'know what, what if we&#146;re friends who don&#146;t see other people?</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> You mean like exclusive friends?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so
terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood
up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Wow. Y'know we&#146;re back where we were. Honey, I would love to do
all that, but nothing&#146;s changed.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s not true, you don&#146;t have a moustache.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Okay, okay, one thing&#146;s changed. But we still want different
things and we know how this is gonna end.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what, I&#146;ve got to walk out of here right now, &#145;cause
getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don&#146;t think I
could do it again.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> I know I couldn&#146;t. So....</p>

<p>(Monica kisses him.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How &#145;bout one last game of racquetball?</p>

<p>(They both kiss, and Richard picks her up and goes over to the bed and starts to lie
down.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Watch the thorns!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> (lying down) Ow!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Awwww.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Jo&#146;s there, but I don&#146;t think there&#146;s anything she could
do.</p>

<p>(Rachel hugs him)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you want to put the book in the freezer?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, Ginger something.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn&#146;t something that sounded like
Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,
(singing) &#145;the movie star.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Aww, man. That&#146;s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out
he&#146;s my roommate, she&#146;s gonna tell him what I did.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, what did you do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can&#146;t, I can&#146;t tell you that,
it&#146;s like the most awful, horrible thing I&#146;ve ever done my whole life.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what, don&#146;t tell us. We&#146;ll just wait until Chandler
gets home, (to Phoebe) because it&#146;ll be more fun that way.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone
out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad&#146;s cabin. Just me,
her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic
dinner....</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You gave her food poisoning!?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of
the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.
So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should&#146;ve told you
about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.</p>

<p>(Phoebe and Monica both stand up and gasp.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I ran!!</p>

<p>[Scene: A street, Chandler is kissing Ginger.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that&#146;s the best kiss I&#146;ve had with anyone I&#146;ve
ever met in a men&#146;s room.</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> Actually, me too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in
a puddle.</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> Oh damn, I hate that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we&#146;re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> Oh, don&#146;t worry about it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, really you&#146;re gonna freeze.</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> No, I&#146;m not.</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> Some day, maybe.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s bedroom, Rachel getting into bed while Ross is reading and laughs.]</p>

Umm, Mark, Mark saying &#145;I&#146;ll see you Saturday.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you
didn&#146;t mind.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, no, no, no, it&#146;s-it&#146;s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, please tell me it&#146;s not because I&#146;m going with Mark.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, well...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God!!! Ross!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I&#146;m sorry, but ah, look if you&#146;re not working with him
anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because, he&#146;s my friend.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with
Mark?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know, you thought &#145;See you Saturday&#146; was funny.
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff
with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really!?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you

look on his face) What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What should I wear, now I&#146;m all nervous.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is looking at her beeper still in the pot. She

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&#146;s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn&#146;t
called. Not that I even care, y'know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe why don&#146;t you just call her? You obviously want to.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You think you know me so well.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, don&#146;t &#145;cha wanna?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, well I do know you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s what I said.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well so?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&#146;t. I can&#146;t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her
and then one day it was &#145;Okay, bye Pheebs&#146; gone. Y'know what the saddest part
is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I&#146;ve ever had in like
all my lives.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Leslie is singing.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk&#146;s gone bad.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So umm, how was your date with Ginger?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Great. It was great. She&#146;s ah, she&#146;s great, great looking,
great personality, she&#146;s greatness.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sounds like she&#146;s got the ah, whole package.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey told you about the leg, huh?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn&#146;t have, but it
did. I mean I like her, I don&#146;t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it&#146;s
like &#145;Hey, y'know what, where&#146;s your leg?&#146; I mean I&#146;m the smallest
person in the world aren&#146;t I? I&#146;m the smallest person in the world.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering from his bedroom) Morning.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Monica) Actually he&#146;s the smallest person in the world.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin&#146; huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It came up.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, I ah, I know it&#146;s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find
that funny?</p>

<p>(Both Chandler and Monica walk away in disgust.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are getting back from the lecture.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) So I nodded off a little.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father&#146;s boat didn&#146;t
make that much noise when it hit rocks!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about
strappy backed dresses.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium
listening to Professor Pitstains and he&#146;s &#145;Hey everybody! Remember that thing
that&#146;s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there&#146;s this little bone we
didn&#146;t know it had!&#146;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> First of all it&#146;s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little
bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn&#146;t fly.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah,
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I
wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, that is so...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an
unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake
it off, thinking it&#146;s alive and attacking him.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with
me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn&#146;t go with Mark?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don&#146;t know, I feel like lately, I
feel like you&#146;re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new
people, and you&#146;ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it&#146;s dumb, but
I hate that I&#146;m not a part of it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&#146;s not dumb. But, maybe it&#146;s okay that you&#146;re not a
part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it&#146;s like, I-I-I like
that you&#146;re not involved in that part of my life.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s a little clearer.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey see, it doesn&#146;t mean that I don&#146;t love you. Because I
do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it&#146;s-it&#146;s for me y'know,
I&#146;m out there, on my own, and I&#146;m doing it and it&#146;s scary but I love it,
because it&#146;s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Ginger are eating dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> Your thinking about my leg aren&#146;t you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> It&#146;s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need
to know is: &#145;How much it bothers you?&#146; because I don&#146;t like wasting my
time. Am I wasting my time?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. No. I don&#146;t think so.</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> Okay. It&#146;s just like anything else, you just have to get used to
it.</p>

<p>(They start making out. She opens his shirt and feels inside and stops.)</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> What&#146;s that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s-that&#146;s my nubbin.</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> What&#146;s a nubbin?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> You have three nipples?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...
(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?</p>

<p><b>Ginger:</b> Ah well, it&#146;s nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I&#146;ll see you
later. Okay. (She leaves and in the hall we see her shake her shoulders like when someone
runs their fingernails across a blackboard.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing as Leslie enters.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren&#146;t coming. What? Where were you?</p>

<p><b>Leslie:</b> Come here, come here. (they go to the side of the stage) Okay,
don&#146;t get mad, okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, don&#146;t give me a reason to get mad, okay</p>

<p><b>Leslie:</b> I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, look, I told you that I didn&#146;t want you to try and sell it, and
you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably
would&#146;ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I
can&#146;t trust you then just forget it. </p>

<p><b>Leslie:</b> No, no, I don&#146;t want to forget it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important
thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but
we won&#146;t be partners. So what&#146;s it gonna be?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Joey are watching TV.]</p>

<p><b>Commercial:</b> (in the background their singing Smelly Cat) Problem odour in the
litter box? Don&#146;t change your kitty, change your kitty litter.</p>

<p>(Monica gets up and shuts off the TV.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sorry, Pheebs.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. You okay?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life&#146;s gonna had you all
kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a
new song?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We&#146;d love too.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (singing) &#145;Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle
whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.&#146; That&#146;s all I have so far.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, happily) Well hello!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Where have you been?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The doctor.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is everything okay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no
waiting.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! It&#146;s like Rachel in High School.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!</p>

<p align="left"><b>Chandler:</b> That was an obvious joke, and I didn&#146;t think of it.
Why didn&#146;t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!</p>

fridge.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of
olives?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I won&#146;t give you anything, but you&#146;ll owe me 2.95.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Done.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages
outside the UN and, I don&#146;t know where his country is.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, let&#146;s start with the free messages outside the UN.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh!! That&#146;s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what
country is this guy from?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There&#146;s a &#145;g&#146; in there.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Where&#146;s that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> In your atlas!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t have an atlas.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, but wait I do have a globe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hold on.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So Pheebs what&#146;s this guy like?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, well he&#146;s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very
sophisticated, and he doesn&#146;t speak any English, but according to his translator, he
totally gets me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> &#145;Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What is this?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s a globe and, a pencil sharpener.</p>

<p>(Phoebe puts the globe right up next to her eye to try and find the country.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I&#146;m going down
to the Xerox place.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, no thanks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, if you don&#146;t have anything to copy, why are you going down
there?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the
belly button ring again?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! You wanna come?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come
on Chloe!!</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> (to Chandler and Joey) Can I help you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh-oh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, y'know what, we&#146;re having second thoughts about our copying
needs. And we&#146;ll need a little more time to think about it.</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> Chloe, switch with me, there&#146;s some guys here that got a crush on
you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Hi guys. I haven&#146;t seen you since this morning.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well ah, ........y'know.</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Maybe. Does that scare ya?</p>

<p>(They both start laughing. They look at each other, stop and step apart a little bit.)</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Relax. It&#146;s just Issac&#146;s D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should
come.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We&#146;ll be there.</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Great. I&#146;ll ah, see ya then.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, rock on. (Does the &#145;Hang 10&#146; sign, then hides his
face in shame.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A Street, Phoebe is walking along with the diplomat (Sergei) and his translator
(Mischa).]</p>

<p><b>Sergei:</b> (something in Russian or Polish)</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> He&#146;s says, &#145;Walking with you makes this strange city, feel
like home.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that&#146;s dumb what I
said, don&#146;t tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and
Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.</p>

<p>(Sergei goes up to her at her door and says something.)</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> (leaning in) Your eyes are very pretty.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!</p>

<p>(Sergei says something and leans in to kiss her, but just as he&#146;s about to....)</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> (leaning in) He would like to kiss you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don&#146;t have to do that now.
(Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don&#146;t! (Mischa tells
Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment&#146;s over.</p>

<p>(Sergei says something and kisses her.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> Oy!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is showing Monica where Sergei&#146;s country is.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! It&#146;s small.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way
across it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So you had fun, huh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Except for, y'know when you&#146;re on a date and you&#146;re
getting along really great but the guy&#146;s translator keeps getting in the way.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe and Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What is ah, Rach in her room?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no, she&#146;s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call
her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this?
Doesn&#146;t she know it&#146;s our anniversary?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.
(holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What&#146;s that on the bottom?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh that&#146;s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe)
She&#146;s fancy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (answering her phone at work) Hello.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, honey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hi.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, what&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I&#146;ve got to get this
order in. Honey, I&#146;m so sorry, but it looks like I&#146;m gonna be here all night.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no-no, no, honey please, I&#146;ve got, I&#146;ve just have so much
to deal with.</p>

<p>[Cut to kitchen.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Monica) Anyway, I&#146;m going out with Sergei again tonight, and
um, could you come and be the translator&#146;s date? So that when we, it&#146;s time for
our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he&#146;s really, he&#146;s kinda cute.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your
friend Spackel Back Larry?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, don&#146;t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the big couch.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did
Chloe say we should be there?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, 10:30.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What time is it now?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> 4:30.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah all right, so we&#146;ll hang out.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. Vividly.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She was kidding about that right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah,
I-I think so...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She was kidding.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up
with a set of ground rules.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your
eyes. Y'know, because you don&#146;t want to be doing something and then look up and see
something you don&#146;t want to be seeing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are
closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab
something with his hand.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...
(clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I guess, but what&#146;s like heads and what&#146;s tails?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well it you don&#146;t know that, then I don&#146;t want to do this
with you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, Rachel and a co-worker (Sophie) are dealing with the
crisis.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on the phone) No, no, no, I&#146;m looking at a purchase order right
here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and
colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I&#146;m wearing?! Can I please speak
to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We&#146;re holding.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering, carrying a basket) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well you said you couldn&#146;t go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the
basket)</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That&#146;s it, on Monday I
start wearing make-up.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but I got cous-cous!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, honey, I&#146;m sorry, I know it&#146;s our anniversary but I
told you on the phone I don&#146;t have time to stop.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, you don&#146;t have to stop, I&#146;m invisible, I&#146;m not here.
(lights a candle)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But I don&#146;t, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?!
(listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the
phone!</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> I love Mark. (to Ross) Do you know Mark?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is
not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this
store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stopping grinding) Pepper?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (angrily) None for me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay sorry, whew.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I&#146;m
sorry but that&#146;s... (notices a fire that Ross&#146;s candle has started) Oh my God!! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that&#146;s a
fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on phone) Excuse me, I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m gonna have to call you
back, I&#146;ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody&#146;s off the phone, how
&#145;bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross you&#146;re not listening to me, I don&#146;t have time to stop.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on Rach, you don&#146;t have what, ten minutes?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t have ten minutes!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don&#146;t!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Don&#146;t yell at me okay, this is the most I&#146;ve seen you all week.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I&#146;ve got a deadline, would
you just go home, I&#146;ll talk to you later. (storms out) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but wait...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good bye!</p>

<p>(Ross starts to pack up the picnic in anger, and throws a three hole punch in the
basket.)</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> Actually, that&#146;s our three hole punch.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is eating the picnic as Rachel comes home from work.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to
me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You had no <b>right</b> coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring
a picnic basket to somebody&#146;s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our
anniversary, boy what an ass am I. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But I told you, I didn&#146;t have the time!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don&#146;t feel like I even
have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my
job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, but it&#146;d be nice if you realised, it&#146;s just a job!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> <b>Just</b> a job!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I&#146;m doing
something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I&#146;m doing
something that I&#146;m actually good at. I mean. if you don&#146;t get that...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I&#146;m happy for ya,
but I&#146;m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I
don&#146;t know what to do anymore.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well neither do I!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is this about Mark?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (shocked) Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, it&#146;s not, it&#146;s not.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,
Ross, no, you&#146;re, you&#146;re, you&#146;re making this too hard.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh I&#146;m, I&#146;m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to
do.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know, I don&#146;t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take
a break.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, fine, you&#146;re right. Let&#146;s ah, let&#146;s take a
break, (goes to the door) let&#146;s cool off, okay, let&#146;s get some frozen yogart, or
something.. (opens the door)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.</p>

<p>(Ross looks at her, then leaves slamming the door behind him.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The Philly, Chandler and Joey are talking to Chloe.]</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got
in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71. </p>

<p>(Chandler agrees in an absolutely bored way.) </p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> (seeing Ross enter) Hey, it&#146;s the dinosaur guy. (runs over to Ross)
Hi, Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, hi Chloe.</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and
Joey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said
we don&#146;t do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime
anybody wants 400, we just say &#145;let&#146;s Ross it!&#146;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And that&#146;s the only colour that comes in.</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Oh! (storms off)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big
anniversary dinner.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we&#146;re gonna break-up instead.</p>

<p>(Chandler and Joey stare at each other in shock.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Phoebe are on their dates with Sergei and Mischa.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock,
knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros
Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.</p>

<p>(Mischa does so.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You didn&#146;t say Boutros Boutros Gali.</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> (to Sergei) Boutros Boutros Gali.</p>

<p>(Sergei responds.)</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> He says he was too.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Interesting.</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> (to Monica) So I was wondering....</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please
tell Sergei that I really like his suit.</p>

<p>(Mischa does so, and Sergei complements Phoebe, and says it slowly)</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> (to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks
you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a
chef?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> Oh, really.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What
are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I was having a conversation.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven&#146;t
been able to say two words to each other.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a
conversation?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That would be great. Thank you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is lying in front of the bay window, and the phone
rings.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Oh, hi. It&#146;s Mark.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (disappointed) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> What? Is it my breath?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn&#146;t tonight your,
your big anniversary dinner?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Well, umm.....</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Rach, are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on the verge of tears) Yeah, I&#146;m fine.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Really, no, please, please, that&#146;s, that&#146;s okay.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> All right, all right, I&#146;m coming over, and I&#146;m bringing Chinese
food.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah, I&#146;m not, I&#146;m not hungry.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> It&#146;s for me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Okay, bye.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Philly.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So what are you gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don&#146;t I have to
wait a while?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, this isn&#146;t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!</p>

<p>(Ross goes to call her.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why? What happened to him?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nothing, he&#146;s just really believes in that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Mark is there, opening Chinese food boxes.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful.
I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted
to take a break, I don&#146;t want to take a break.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Wow. I&#146;m sorry. Eggroll?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn&#146;t there.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Well, then he&#146;s, he&#146;s probably just, out.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, thank you that&#146;s very helpful, I&#146;m glad you came over.</p>

<p>(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi! It&#146;s me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Oh, I&#146;m so glad you called.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really? I&#146;ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don&#146;t,
don&#146;t you think we can work on this? </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Hey, what do you want to drink?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who&#146;s that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nobody.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?</p>

<p>(Rachel mouths &#145;Shoot!&#146; or something similar.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is that Mark?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, honey, look he just came over to....</p>

<p>[Cut to The Philly.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, that&#146;s okay, thanks.</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Hey, you don&#146;t have to smile. You just have to dance.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I don&#146;t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Oh, okay. (to the bartender) Hey, two beers. (sits down next to him) </p>

<p>[Scene: The Restaurant, after dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> (to Monica) And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away,
while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don&#146;t accidentally suck
it up through your nose and choke on it.</p>

<p>(Sergei says something to Mischa.)</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> (to Phoebe) Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, tell him, apology accepted.</p>

<p>(Mischa does so.)</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> (to Monica) Oh, he&#146;s unbelievable. I mean for the first time in
three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let
me enjoy that, no!! (to Sergei) You silly diplomat, why don&#146;t you learn some English,
Sergei?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Excuse me, but umm, isn&#146;t he paying for your dinner?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, the man&#146;s dog just died.</p>

<p>(Sergei insults Mischa, and they get into a huge fight, in Russian.)</p>

<p><b>Mischa:</b> (to Monica) I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me
to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your
guy can&#146;t even say coupons. (they leave)</p>

<p><b>Sergei:</b> Uh, (picks up a plate) plate?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Plate! Yes, plate.</p>

<p><b>Sergei:</b> Plate. Plate. Plate.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> See, we don&#146;t need them.</p>

<p><b>Sergei:</b> (picking up a cup) Plate?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Philly, <i>With or Without You</i> is playing. (Which is the same song Ross
played for Rachel in TOW the List.)]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Chloe) I like this song.</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Well, you&#146;re practically dancing already. Why don&#146;t you just do
it over here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, no, no.</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> What? Are you married? &#145;Cause that&#146;s okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is next to the bay window again, Mark has left.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be
home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you&#146;re not home.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Philly, Ross is dancing with Chloe.]</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Still no smile?</p>

<p>(She kisses him. Ross leans back for a second, and then they both kiss, more
passionately this time as U2's <em>With or Without You</em> plays in the background.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I mean, I don&#146;t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you&#146;ve
got a girlfriend?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is this about Mark?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (shocked) Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, it&#146;s not, it&#146;s not.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look,
urrgh, maybe we should take a break.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine, you&#146;re right. Let&#146;s ah, let&#146;s take a break, (goes to
the door) let&#146;s cool off, okay, let&#146;s get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
(opens the door)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. A break from us.</p>

<p>(Ross looks at her, then leaves slamming the door behind him.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Mark is there, opening Chinese food boxes.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a
break, I don&#146;t want to take a break.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on the phone) I&#146;ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don&#146;t,
don&#146;t you think we can work on this? </p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Hey, what do you want to drink?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who&#146;s that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nobody.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is that Mark?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, we never actually got to dinner.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohhh, nice.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, we kinda broke up instead.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and
fruit flies everywhere.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it&#146;s on the ceiling.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on
my ceiling! You broke up?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but it&#146;s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no!! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, you and Mark?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no-no, it&#146;s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised
how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to
make it work.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s Bedroom, Ross is waking up. He straightens himself out on the bed

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on answering machine) Hi, it&#146;s me. I&#146;ve been trying to reach
you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and
Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
(He&#146;s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! </p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> That&#146;s so great for you guys!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! </p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> You must be so happy!</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Good luck, with your girlfriend. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between
their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind
the door) Rachel!!!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, there&#146;s banana on it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, good. Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Now what is Fabutec?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, all right don&#146;t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this
info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before,
except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so
amazing....</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Waxine!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes! Have you seen it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&#146;s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God. Do think it really doesn&#146;t hurt? &#145;Cause how can they do
that?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain
forest!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They have the best stuff in there.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross has told Chandler and Joey his terrible act.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God! Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. We figured when we couldn&#146;t find you, you&#146;d gone home to
make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You think?! God, I, ah, I&#146;m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do?
Rachel&#146;s all like, &#145;I love you and, and let&#146;s work on this.&#146; And all I
can think about is, &#145;What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?&#146; when I tell
her what I did.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more
important question. How dumb are you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! Look, we&#146;re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How
am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, Ross look, I&#146;m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,
just not about stuff that&#146;s gonna get you in trouble.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He&#146;s right. Nobody&#146;s gonna benefit, and you&#146;re just
gonna hurt her.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, and there won&#146;t be a relationship left to rebuild.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but don&#146;t you think....</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait
until the timing&#146;s right. And that&#146;s what deathbeds are for.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the
footrest extended.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn&#146;t find out
some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about
the trail?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What trail?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The
trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!
(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I-I don&#146;t think there&#146;s any trail.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac&#146;s
sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe&#146;s
friends with Rachel. And that&#146;s the trail, I did it!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica's Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are waxing their legs.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen
strips to leg number one, </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did that!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Grasp one of the linen strips by its &#145;easy grab tab&#146; and pull
it off in one quick pain free motion.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Was it not pain-free?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with
a little wax.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don&#146;t
seem to think it&#146;s that bad.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so
stupid. But hey, y'know if you don&#146;t believe me, please, by my guest.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Now, are you glad we didn&#146;t start with the bikini strips?</p>

<p>[Scene: The Xerox Place, Ross is trying to break the trail.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Chloe? Hi.. </p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Is this about me taking your watch?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You took my watch?</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> I&#146;m sorry, I do that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Oh no. I feel it isn&#146;t really anybody&#146;s business, y'know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Exactly. So you didn&#146;t, didn&#146;t mention anything to Issac right?</p>

<p><b>Chloe:</b> Oh, well I tell Issac everything.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we
haven&#146;t actually met...</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> You dog!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, that&#146;s the one. Listen, I don&#146;t want to hurt her.</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> Oh, hey, man I know, doesn&#146;t matter how much we love &#145;em,
monogamy is too cruel a rule.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We&#146;re
the same, you and me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Actually, no, we&#146;re not.</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> Yeah, we are.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, we&#146;re not.</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> Yeah, we are.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, we&#146;re not!!</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> Okay, we&#146;re not.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> But, we are.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine. I just need to know that you&#146;re not gonna tell your sister.</p>

<p><b>Issac:</b> I can promise not to tell her again.</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe&#146;s Work, Ross is now trying to stop Jasmine from telling Phoebe.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering out of breath) Jasmine? </p>

<p><b>Jasmine:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We met at Phoebe&#146;s birthday party, I&#146;m, I&#146;m Ross Geller.</p>

<p><b>Jasmine:</b> You did a bad thing!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, I did.</p>

<p><b>Jasmine:</b> Very bad!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Very bad.</p>

<p><b>Jasmine:</b> Very, very bad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe
yet?</p>

<p><b>Jasmine:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, Jasmine, please, please don&#146;t. I love my girlfriend very much,
and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Jasmine:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you, thank you.</p>

<p><b>Jasmine:</b> But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he
knows Phoebe too.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (angrily) Who&#146;s your roommate?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is wiping down the counter as Ross rushes in.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn&#146;t say anything to
Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> I&#146;m sorry. Was I not supposed to?</p>

<p>(Ross turns around and sees Rachel sitting by the window. She is just glaring at him.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica&#146;s Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are removing the rest of their wax
strips.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ow!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ow!! Ow!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ow!!!</p>

<p><b>Monica and Phoebe:</b> Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!</p>

<p>(Hearing the screaming Chandler and Joey rush in. Joey has a pan, Chandler has a tea
kettle.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We&#146;re all right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s okay, it&#146;s okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We&#146;re all right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We were just waxing our legs.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Off?!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever
experience.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well I don&#146;t think you can make that statement, unless
you&#146;ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,
that&#146;s all. I mean, come on, it&#146;s just a little wax.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey&#146;s arm and puts a
strip on it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that&#146;s mature.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s right.</p>

<p>(Joey laughs, pulls it off, then does a high-pitched whine.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room, Rachel is trying to close the door on Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom, Chandler slowly closes the door, and we hear Rachel from the
living room.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can&#146;t talk to you. I can&#146;t even look at you right now!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing, nothing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel?</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just get away from me!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Whe-where did he put it?!</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you had sex with another woman!</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom, both Monica and Phoebe gasp.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not
grow at all yesterday.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and
you didn&#146;t tell us?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just get out! Now!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay! All right! How was she?</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh-oh.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Was she good?</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don&#146;t answer that.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let&#146;s talk
about it!! How was she?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She was...</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Awful! Horrible!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She was not good. Not good.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She was nothing compared to you.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She, she was different.</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ewwwww!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh-oh.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good different?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nobody likes change.</p>

<p>(Rachel picks up a newspaper and starts beating him with it.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Should we do something?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sorry, okay, I&#146;m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself,
and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,
and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend
leave? (Ross can&#146;t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She
was in there, when I was in there?!</p>

<p>(Ross hands Rachel back the newspaper, and she starts beating him with it again.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant
nothing to me!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! </p>

<p>(She throws the paper at him, misses and hits Monica&#146;s door, they all jump back at
the sound.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I didn&#146;t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I
thought we were broken up. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We were on a break!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You think you&#146;re gonna get out of this on a technicality?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I&#146;m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our
relationship was dead!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know what, I don&#146;t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to
open the door)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can&#146;t go out there.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why not?! (to Chandler) I&#146;m hungry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because they&#146;ll know we&#146;ve been listening.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to
make sure that didn&#146;t happen!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, that is so sweet. I think I&#146;m falling in love with you all over
again.</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more
important things to worry about.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, we&#146;ll be fine.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then
Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we&#146;re never leaving,
ever.</p>

<p>[Later, Phoebe is on the phone, they&#146;re all still trapped in Monica&#146;s
bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi, it&#146;s Phoebe. Listen someone&#146;s gonna have to take my 9:00
with Mr. Rehack, &#145;cause it&#146;s like 9:15 now, and I&#146;m not there.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Don&#146;t you realise none of this would&#146;ve ever happened if I
didn&#146;t think at that same moment you weren&#146;t having sex with Mark?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right. Let&#146;s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been
able to forgive me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (pause) Yes I would.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You&#146;d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked
with me, and made love to me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (less sure) Yes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay,
okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because
it&#146;s, I mean it&#146;s you.</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Ohhhhh!</p>

<p>[Later, Ross and Rachel are sitting in the kitchen.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? Come on Rach, tell me what you&#146;re thinking?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m thinking, I&#146;m gonna order a pizza.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Order a pizza like, &#145;I forgive you?&#146;</p>

<p>(She turns around and glares at him, he turns away.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic
message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We could eat the wax! It&#146;s organic.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh great, food with hair on it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, not the used wax.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because <b>that</b> would be crazy?</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I&#146;m kinda hungry myself.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I&#146;d like to order a large pizza.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No anchovies.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> With ah, extra anchovies.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s okay, I&#146;ll just pick &#145;em off.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in
the sauce?</p>

<p>[Cut to later, they are finishing up the pizza, there&#146;s one piece left.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You can have the last piece, if you want.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom, they&#146;re all eating the wax, Chandler and Phoebe,
don&#146;t like it. Joey tries some and makes a face like: &#145;Hey, that&#146;s not so
bad.&#146;]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They&#146;re gonna get through this, aren&#146;t they?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, come on, it&#146;s Ross and Rachel, they&#146;ve got too.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What if they don&#146;t?</p>

<p>(Long pause.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You think I need a new walk?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well y'know, I&#146;ve been walking the same way since high school.
Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I
need a &#145;take notice&#146; walk.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you actually saying these words?</p>

<p>[Later, in the living room, Rachel is sitting on the couch, Ross is on the chair.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, now you&#146;re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee
table) Look Rachel, I-I&#146;m sorry, okay, I&#146;m sorry, I was out of my mind. I
thought I&#146;d lost you, I didn&#146;t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane
must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don&#146;t cheat right, I,
that&#146;s not me, I&#146;m not Joey!</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a &#145;come on&#146;
look.) Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey. It&#146;s three in the morning. They don&#146;t know that I&#146;ve
come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know what, y'know what, I&#146;m-I&#146;m not the one that wanted that,
that break, okay. You&#146;re the one that bailed on us. You&#146;re the one that, that
ran when things got just a little rough!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s....</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s what?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That is neither here nor there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, well here we are. Now we&#146;re in a tough spot again, Rach. What
do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do
you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible,
stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I&#146;m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I
can&#146;t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can&#146;t see us
throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.</p>

<p>(He kisses her on her shoulder, then her neck, then the side of her face, then just
before he kisses her on the lips....)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don&#146;t! You can&#146;t
just kiss me and think you&#146;re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn&#146;t work
that way. It doesn&#146;t just make it better. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (softly) I think you should go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (softly) I really think you need to go now.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said
there was nothing so big that we couldn&#146;t work past it together...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, what the hell did I know!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, look, there&#146;s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,
(takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can&#146;t imagine, I can&#146;t imagine my life
without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your
face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her
waist) and, and....</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (crying) No. I can&#146;t, you&#146;re a totally different person to me
now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now
I just can&#146;t stop picturing with her, I can&#146;t, (Ross stands up and backs away)
it doesn&#146;t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It&#146;s just changed,
everything. Forever.</p>

<p>[We see the rest of them are now crying.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (crying) Yeah, but this can&#146;t be it, I mean.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then how come it is?</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica&#146;s bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They&#146;ve been quiet for a long time.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe she killed him?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Let&#146;s go.</p>

<p>[Cut to Living Room, Rachel is sleeping on the couch, Ross is gone, the rest of them
can finally emerge from their cell. They all wave good bye, and start to walk quietly out,
as Monica goes and puts a blanket on Rachel. Joey starts walking all hunched over and
bobbing his shoulders as he goes.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) Is that your new walk?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (whispering) No, I really have to pee.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch reading.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Can I see the comics?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This is the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, <b>may</b> I see the comics?</p>

<p>[Monica and Phoebe enter.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We are. He&#146;s meeting us here.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Rachel is meeting <b>us</b> here.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh come on, they can be in the same room.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why? What happened now?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well Ross was hangin&#146; out over at our place, Rachel comes over to
borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to
borrow something.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He&#146;s the one who slept with
someone else. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,
that she should of forgiven him by now.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what
he means. Oh my God, this is like <i>60 Minutes</i>, okay, when, when, at first
you&#146;re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know
you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.
Man, I hope Ross doesn&#146;t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they
never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I had the same dream!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I had the opposite dream.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what maybe it&#146;s gonna be okay, I mean it&#146;s been a
week.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I mean it&#146;s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s never taken you more than a <b>shower</b> to get over a
relationship.</p>

<p>[Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (seeing her) Okay, let&#146;s go!! Let&#146;s hit the road!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Let&#146;s get the show on it! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it&#146;s sooo close.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Closer than here?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found
coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let&#146;s skedaddle.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait, I&#146;m not just gonna drink somebody&#146;s old coffee.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, your highness.</p>

<p>[Ross enters behind Rachel, and look at each other for a moment.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I&#146;m really sorry.
(imitating Rachel) That&#146;s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross)
Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the whole gang is there, except for Ross and Rachel. Joey
is trying to eat Chinese with chopsticks and fails miserably. There&#146;s a knock on the
door, and Chandler answers it to reveal Rachel]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (softly) Is he here?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. (smiles) Here&#146;s your moisturiser. Hi! </p>

<p><b>Monica and Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five
tickets, <i>Calvin Klein</i> lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they&#146;re
all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, yes, it&#146;s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans
with Ross.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Rach, it&#146;s, it&#146;s ah, it&#146;s not that we don&#146;t want to,
really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And heels.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel,
Chandler mouths &#145;Come on!&#146;) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and
we set that night aside.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that&#146;s only fair. (leaves)</p>

<p>[Chandler makes a noise of absolute disgust and heads into the living room.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Very bad.</p>

<p>[We see Chandler lighting up a cigarette.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Chandler what are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You&#146;re smoking again?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I&#146;m,
I&#146;m smoking still.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, I&#146;m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which
is when I started smoking in the first place.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Weren&#146;t you nine?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeahhh. I&#146;m tellin&#146; ya something, that ah, first smoke after
nap time....</p>

<p>[There&#146;s a knock on the door.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that&#146;s great, with my luck, that&#146;s gonna be him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Him? Him, Ross?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got
divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and
it&#146;s Rachel again.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my
sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing.
Huh? I&#146;m asking you first, right?!. I mean I&#146;m playing by the rules.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Absolutely, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler! You&#146;re smoking? What are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, shut up!! You&#146;re not my real Mom!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s, the gang, minus Rachel of course, is there. Chandler is forced to
smoke by an open window.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can
cut glass over here!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait. Really?! &#145;Cause mine get me out of tickets.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending
this time with me. It&#146;s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say
thanks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon
okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an
Irish accent) Two days of darts, it&#146;ll be great!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;ll be great for next weekend.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no, this weekend guys!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent)
it&#146;ll be grrreat.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel&#146;s
sister&#146;s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, for the whole weekend?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We&#146;re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, that&#146;s okay, I mean if you guys <b>all</b> have to go away for
the first weekend I&#146;m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know what, I can stay, I&#146;m gonna stay. &#145;Cause the last time
I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your
grandmother&#146;s cab, but y'know what, I&#146;ll stay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Noo! I&#146;ll stay. He&#146;s my brother.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What a pity stay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! We&#146;re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pity food? Y'know what that&#146;s okay, all right, I don&#146;t need any
of you to stay, okay nobody stays.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.</p>

<p>[Scene: In Phoebe&#146;s Grandmother&#146;s cab, driving up to the cabin. Phoebe&#146;s
driving, Rachel&#146;s sitting shotgun, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are in the back seat.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why? Do you think he&#146;s still mad at us?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) Well he&#146;s probably mad after you called him this
morning to borrow his goggles.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Mine aren&#146;t tinted.</p>

<p>[Chandler starts to light a cigarette.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Chandler!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What does the sign say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Beam me up Jesus.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, the &#145;No Smoking&#146; sign. There&#146;s no smoking in my
Grandmother&#146;s cab.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Please!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, come on, there&#146;s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I
really have to goooooooooo.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, now I have to go!!</p>

<p>[Scene: The rest stop, Phoebe&#146;s pulling in.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p>[Both Chandler and Joey put their feet up against the glass, Monica doesn&#146;t and
gets thrown up against the glass.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ow!</p>

<p>[Joey gets out and sprints to the bathroom and Chandler follows with a cigarette in his
hands.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Rachel, who&#146;s staying in the cab.) Aren&#146;t you gonna go?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is &#145;no
tissue, no tuschy.&#146; (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody&#146;s going.
(She gets out and starts to close the door.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, y'know what don&#146;t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking
themselves out.) &#145;cause the... keys...are in there.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) My lighter&#146;s in there! (points to the cab)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The rest stop, the gang is still stuck, Chandler is kneeling at the rear
bumper.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe&#146;s not hot enough to light this!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put
it on this morning.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, if you&#146;re parents hadn&#146;t got divorced, you&#146;d be able
to answer a question like a normal person?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys
give me the underwire from your bra!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Please!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the
biggest wire.</p>

<p><b>The Girls:</b> No, not getting my bra!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, Monica&#146;s are the biggest.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it&#146;s gotta be Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually
sometimes, st-stuff my bra.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right then, your bra would still be big.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I stuff outside the bra.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ladies, ladies, let&#146;s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take
off Monica&#146;s bra.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.</p>

<p>[Chandler crumples up his cigarette pack and throws it on the ground.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right
there.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and
save us.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, now let&#146;s decide who has the nicest ass.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (opening the door) And there you go!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh, yeahhhhh!!!</p>

<p>[They all run to get in the cab, and Chandler pulls out a smoke.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> At least let me smoke it to the good part.</p>

<p>[Phoebe puts the car in gear and starts to back out.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, what&#146;s it, what&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, this has happened before.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So you know how to fix it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep. Put more gas in.</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol and Susan&#146;s, Carol is setting a romantic dinner for Susan as there
is a knock on the door.]</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (answering the door) Hi! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Hey, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you
get the tape that was half the last episode of <em>M*A*S*H</em> and half the hostages
coming home?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ah yeah, but now it&#146;s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming
home.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Where&#146;s Ben?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> He&#146;s sleeping.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Umm, yeah, actually, Susan&#146;s gonna be home any minute, it&#146;s
kinda an anniversary.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> It&#146;s not that kind of anniversary.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah! (realises) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Sooo!! Anyway...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. &#145;Cause you
know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so
Rachel and I broke up.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should
probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah, I&#146;d love that.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, great! Me too.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the
table.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The rest stop, Phoebe is on the phone to the motor club.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Great!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, what town are we near?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route
we&#146;re on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel)
There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know, I&#146;m sorry, I always slept in the back when we
drove up here.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check
every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don&#146;t do
that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a
half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live
here! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But if...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you&#146;ll have to
think of something else.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.</p>

<p>[Joey walks up helping Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So the going for help went well?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another
cigarette.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Then why are you smoking?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well it&#146;s very unsettling.</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol and Susan&#146;s, Ross is eating the dinner Carol made for Susan.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ....right? Right? I mean it&#146;s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they
just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t need
them, huh, I&#146;ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ah, Susan will be so pleased.</p>

<p>[Ross&#146;s beeper goes off.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where&#146;s 717? (He gets up to
return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross
grabs the last piece.) Hey, you&#146;ve have more of these for Susan right?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> No. But it&#146;s okay, I&#146;ll just put out pickles or something.</p>

<p>[Cut to the rest stop, Monica and Phoebe are waiting anxiously by the phone as it
rings.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I ate a bug.</p>

<p>[Rachel starts to walk up.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a
penny. Let&#146;s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don&#146;t know where we are, so
we can&#146;t get a tow truck.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, now you want a favour?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, please.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, oh, I&#146;m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I&#146;m a little
too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got
home safely okay?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (running over and grabbing the phone away from Ross) (on phone) Phoebe,
hang on a second. (Hands Ross her keys) Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I&#146;m not gonna pick them up.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Listen, we both know you&#146;re gonna do it &#145;cause you&#146;re not
a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or
save us both time and sulk in the car.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, Rachel doesn&#146;t want me to....</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you &#145;cause she fell in love
with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don&#146;t punish
your friends for what Rachel did to you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, you&#146;re right.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (on phone) Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. (listens)
What? (listens) (to Ross) You slept with someone else?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms
down) yeah. Where are you? I&#146;ll find you. (hangs up)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> You slept with another woman?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you-you&#146;re-you&#146;re one to talk.</p>

<p>[Scene: The rest stop, Joey is making a sign.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, done.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (reading the sign) What&#146;s &#145;pleh&#146;?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s &#145;help&#146; spelled backwards so that the helicopters can
read it from the air!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Huh. What&#146;s doofus spelled backwards?</p>

<p>[Ross drives up.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it&#146;s Ross) Ugh!!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&#146;s Ross on one of his drives!</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Hey!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What is he doing here?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> <b>He</b> is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I&#146;m stepping on
some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I&#146;ve got plenty of people to help
on the Interstate.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> No! Come on!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right!! Fine! Fine.</p>

<p>[Ross grabs the gas can he brought along, and walks through Joey&#146;s sign destroying
it.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Arrrghh!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no, now it&#146;s not gonna make any sense!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who
drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we&#146;re then
gonna go skiing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, this is horrible, it&#146;s just horrible.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ask me what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey:</b> No, I wasn&#146;t gonna ask you that, no.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s horrible.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastic) Oh please, can&#146;t I come to your special, magical cabin?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why would you even want to come Ross? You&#146;re a horrible skier.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Here we go again.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I-I can&#146;t handle this, you guys.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right Pheebs, your cab&#146;s ready.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, let&#146;s go!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You&#146;re welcome.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I&#146;m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone

<p><b>Ross:</b> We were on a break!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know Ross why don&#146;t you put <b>that</b> on your answering
machine!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey-hey, it&#146;s valid okay? And I&#146;m not the only one who thinks
so, Monica agrees with me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Monica) What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (shyly) I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s what you said last night.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What I said was, was that I understood. Joey&#146;s the one who agreed
with you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really Joey?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (pause) What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I think it&#146;s very obvious who&#146;s wrong here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Obviously not to Joey.</p>

<p>[They all turn around and look at Joey.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (pause) What?</p>

<p>[They all start fighting with each other.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do.
No-no-no-no.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to
stop the fighting.)</p>

<p>[They stop briefly to look at Chandler, but then start fighting again.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues
to dance.) Look what you&#146;re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and
Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts
to leave) You don&#146;t, all right you don&#146;t have to love each other, okay? You
don&#146;t, you don&#146;t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you
have to figure out a way to be around each other.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, and not put us in the middle.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, otherwise, I mean that&#146;s, that&#146;s, that&#146;s just it
for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you
be civil?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Good, all right, let&#146;s get back in the car, &#145;cause
it&#146;s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who&#146;s going
with who?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross
cuts him off.) No, I&#146;m, you, you planned this all out, and I don&#146;t want to ruin
it, so you guys should just go.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on man, you drove all the way up here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, really, I&#146;ve got to take the car back anyway, I&#146;m
spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It&#146;s fine, no guilt I promise.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ahh, nooo!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the
best one I could, &#145;cause that&#146;s not where you want to skimp.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> You&#146;re a genius, Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even
110?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Okay, I&#146;ll pay you tomorrow. (pushes him out the door)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Okay, bye!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go,
y'know?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Yeah, okay, bye. (closes the door, turns out the lights, and runs back to
the bedroom)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (outside the door) So I&#146;m gonna take off then!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, all but Chandler are there, Joey laughs for no apparent reason.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Joey) What&#146;s so funny?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, nothing, no. It&#146;s an acting exercise, I&#146;m practising my fake
laugh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. (she laughs)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What-what&#146;s so funny?</p>

<p>(Chandler enters with a cigarette.)</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> (to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there&#146;s none of that in here.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Okay, but only if you give me a drag.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(Chandler hands him the cigarette, and he takes a long drag.)</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler
back the cigarette.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, why don&#146;t you hang on to that one.</p>

<p>(He goes and sits down next to Rachel and puts a cigarette in his mouth, which Rachel
takes away from him. He puts another cigarette in his mouth, and Rachel takes it away
again.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, that&#146;s like the least fun game ever.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I&#146;m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that
is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking
patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake
laughs.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on, it&#146;s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two
weeks straight and she hasn&#146;t smoked since.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pffhah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross) What&#146;s your problem?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nothing, it&#146;s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh right, &#145;cause you always pull your pants down at the count of
three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have
to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Or what my Father called Thursday night.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier, Ross is handing Rachel a cup of coffee.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Here you go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, y'know what, I didn&#146;t want cinnamon on this.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his
hand.)</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!! </p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Frank! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> How are you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh, well y'know, I would&#146;ve called but I lost your phone number and
then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn&#146;t find it. And then, I tried
to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Well, we got into a fight &#145;cause ah, she said I was to immature to
get married.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Your getting married?!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh, yeah!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> My little brother&#146;s getting married!!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh, I knew you&#146;d be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you
want to meet her?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Do I?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Do you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I do, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. (to Joey) I&#146;m
gonna, I&#146;m gonna get my ah, my fiance man!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I would&#146;ve bet good money that he&#146;d be the first one
of us to get married.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, isn&#146;t it fantastic?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don&#146;t you think he&#146;s a little young to
get married?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What, he&#146;s 18.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Exactly, it&#146;ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Always illegal Joe.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> (entering with his fiance Alice, who is obviously much, much older than
he is) Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight. (he points out Phoebe to her)</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Y'know it-it&#146;s funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your
not how I pictured you at all.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I&#146;m a big surprise.</p>

<p>(Ross lets them both sit in his chair.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, um, how-how did you guys meet?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight&#146;s ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I
always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> And he was my best student.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah, she was my best teacher. </p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Ohhh. (They embrace in a very passionate kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If that doesn&#146;t keep kids in school, what will?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And so now you guys are gonna be married?</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to
have kids right away.</p>

<p>(Both Chandler and Phoebe have shocked looks on their faces.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God!! Great!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you&#146;re ready for that?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who
doesn&#146;t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah,
now-now I always will, &#145;cause y'know, it&#146;ll be me. Right?</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there&#146;s an age difference
between us.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh good! Okay. &#145;Cause you were acting like you didn&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?</p>

<p>(They both growl and hiss at each other and then kiss passionately again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s bedroom, Chandler is listening to the hypnosis tape.]</p>

<p><b>Hypnosis Tape:</b> You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now
completely asleep. You don&#146;t need to smoke. Cigarettes don&#146;t control you. You
are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Moondance Diner, Monica is working, Rachel is having lunch.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I&#146;ve only gone
out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you
gotta get me back in the game.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, that shouldn&#146;t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all
I meet are eligible straight men.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you&#146;re given&#146;
&#145;em out.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Haven&#146;t you and I covered that topic?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you&#133;.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig,
and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Well, if that were true, I&#146;d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times
we went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out with
me, don&#146;t you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean
that ain&#146;t a pretty picture in the morning, y&#146;know what I mean. That wig all in
disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean really, think about it.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Ho-ho, I will.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are being lectured by Phoebe.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I know, I know, that this is Frank&#146;s life, (walks behind them,
they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don&#146;t want to
be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it&#146;s sick and wrong!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no, oh, I&#146;m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts
sticking it&#146;s tongue down my little brother&#146;s throat! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But, I mean, do you think he&#146;s gonna enjoy it when he&#146;s up to
his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not
fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and
it-it&#146;s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it&#146;s not good home economics.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, have-have you told him how you feel?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. Not out loud.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, if you don&#146;t tell him, soon he&#146;s gonna be married, and
then you&#146;re gonna hate yourself.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he&#146;s gonna hate myself. I mean
look at him and his Mom, I can&#146;t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk
him out of it.</p>

<p><b>Ross and Joey:</b> No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them,
and turns them back to face her.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose.
Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!</p>

<p><b>Ross and Joey:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I&#146;m gonna go get Frank. (exits)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So, we&#146;re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,
&#147;Hey, let&#146;s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,&#148; remember? And then, and
then, you turn to me and say, &#147;Nah, let&#146;s just hang out at your place.&#148;
Well, that was a nice move dumb ass. </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Monica are entering.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I think you should definitely go out with this guy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nah, he doesn&#146;t do anything for me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on <i>Walker: Texas Ranger</i>?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids&#133;.
(realises) All right, I get your point.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just
carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what, pretty good.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good! I haven&#146;t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and
confident, that is a stunning blouse.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Here you go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey Mon, let&#146;s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems
really nice, and that check thing was adorable.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What check thing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000
tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I&#146;d call him.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete&#133; (quickly grabs a magazine
and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s Bill Clinton.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Who&#146;s he huggin&#146;?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! That&#146;s Pete! But why is Bill huggin&#146; Pete?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that
program!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We use it!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There you go!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, Monica&#146;s gonna go out with a millionaire. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m not gonna go out with him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, I can&#146;t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is
just so exciting.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Or incredibly offensive.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah, sure, that too.</p>

<p>(Chandler is putting on the Chap Stick the same way that women put on lipstick,
including the bit with the piece of tissue.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to the girls who are staring at him) What?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are talking to Frank.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All we&#146;re saying is don&#146;t rush into anything.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, come on, think about it. You&#146;re 18, okay, she&#146;s 44, when
you&#146;re 36, she&#146;s gonna be 88.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> What, you don&#146;t think I know that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, the point is, there&#146;s a lot of women out there you haven&#146;t
even had sex with yet!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, he-he&#146;s right, he&#146;s right. This is your time y'know, yeah,
you&#146;re young, you&#146;re-you&#146;re weird, chicks dig that.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Okay, but isn&#146;t sex better when it&#146;s with one person that you
really, really care about.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, in a poem maybe.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No the man&#146;s right, that&#146;s what I had with Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> You don&#146;t have it anymore?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I ah, I slept with someone else.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It didn&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I&#146;ve got with
Alice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now, wh-what, what is that like?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> It&#146;s so cool man, it&#146;s so, it&#146;s just &#145;cause being
with her is so much better than like not being with her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Ross) Why can&#146;t I find that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Don&#146;t ask me, I had it and I blew it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I want it!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> You can have it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know, maybe I can&#146;t. I mean, maybe there&#146;s
something wrong with me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, no! No!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> It&#146;s out there man! I&#146;ve seen it! I got it!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Then you hold on to it!!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> All right, man!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it&#146;s after Ross and Joey&#146;s talk with Frank, and
Phoebe&#146;s is finding out what happened.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Joey) You&#146;re Frank&#146;s best man?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I couldn&#146;t help it, there love is so pure.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m the ring bearer.</p>

<p>(As Phoebe stands there in shock and disbelief, Chandler comes out of the bathroom and
walks to his bedroom. He&#146;s just got out of the shower and has the towel wrapped
around himself high across his chest, and another towel wrapped around his head, like
women wear towels. Joey watches Chandler wondering what the hell he&#146;s doing.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe&#146;s, Phoebe is opening the door.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I&#146;m so glad you could come, &#145;cause
I&#146;ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge
mustard stain on it.)</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Oh my God, who died on this?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I know. It&#146;s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Absolutely. Okay, first we&#146;ll start with a little club soda and
salt, and then if that doesn&#146;t work we can go back to&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know what, forget it. It&#146;s ruined. </p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Oh no-no, never say that. If we can&#146;t get it out then we can cut
around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.</p>

<p>[Scene: Pete&#146;s office, he is participating in a conference call with three other
employees, each of whom are on a different TV screen that he controls with a remote.]</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Okay, that&#146;s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on
the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>(The intercom buzzes.)</p>

<p><b>Secretary:</b> You have a Miss Monica Geller here.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. (Monica enters) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What the hell is this? (holding up the check)</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Hang on a second. (to the employees) I&#146;ll-I&#146;ll talk to you in
the morning. (turns two of the three off) I&#146;m sorry what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Well, y&#146;know, I never know how much to tip.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You&#146;re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I
mean, what&#146;s-what&#146;s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way
you get girls to go out with you?</p>

<p><b>Employee:</b> Umm, I&#146;m still here.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> (turns off the TV) You&#146;re taking this all wrong. Because, if I
didn&#146;t leave you that tip, you wouldn&#146;t of come down here, we wouldn&#146;t be
having this argument, and there wouldn&#146;t be this ah, heat between us.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new
level now. &#145;Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now
we&#146;re like this-this couple that fights.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, umm, you&#146;re a loon.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Look, forget the check, okay. (rips up the check) I like you. I think
you&#146;re great. Come on, what do you say?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> &#145;Cause I don&#146;t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> One meal! That&#146;s all I&#146;m asking for. Please? We go out, we eat,
and if you don&#146;t have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe&#146;s, she is coming home. She turns on the lights, and sits down on
the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> (hiding under a pile of clothes) Hi. (She jumps up screaming.) Wait, no!
Just put the mail down. It&#146;s-it&#146;s me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought
I&#146;d curl up in it. Is that all right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh, well just probably the worst one since I&#146;ve been alive.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What umm, what happened?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don&#146;t
see how I could all of the sudden be too young, &#145;cause I&#146;m older than I was when
we first got together.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, yeah, no, I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t know. But, y'know what, maybe
it&#146;s just all for the best?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life!
After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and
then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it&#146;s still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now
it&#146;s, and now it&#146;s gone and I don&#146;t know why!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh, well I can tell you why. It&#146;s, it&#146;s because of me. But,
y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made
her see why you two shouldn&#146;t be together, y'know. And you&#146;re gonna see it to,
one day, you really, really will.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn&#146;t want us to be together, but the
worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, but.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you&#146;d
understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or
a place to go&#133;</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Monica ready for her date. The guys are
also there. The door buzzes.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! The millionaire&#146;s here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Guys, please, I&#146;m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him
anything.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, then get the lobster!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>

<p>(They&#146;re all staring at him, with big, huge smiles on their faces.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And that&#146;s why, I&#146;m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts
to leave) Bye.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh-no-no-no-no&#133;.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just one drink?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Hey, you like pizza?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that&#146;s sounds great.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I know a great little place.</p>

<p>[Cut to a shot of the coliseum in Rome, Italy.]</p>

<p>[Scene: A restaurant in Rome, Monica is paying for the pizza.]</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> You&#146;re, hey, you&#146;re not paying for the pizza!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh come on, it&#146;s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is
that enough lire?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Ahh, I&#146;d throw another thousand on that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why, how much is that?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> That&#146;s about 60 cents.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it&#146;s the middle of the night. Joey is walking into
the living room, and runs into the entertainment centre.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Every night!! </p>

<p>(He starts to walk to the bathroom and hears the hypnosis tape from Chandler&#146;s
bedroom.)</p>

<p><b>Hypnosis Tape:</b> You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don&#146;t control you. You
are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who
does not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe&#146;s, Frank is watching TV, and he&#146;s very depressed as Phoebe
enters.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally
evil thing, but I so didn&#146;t. There&#146;s someone here who can explain this better
than I can.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Hi Frank.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Hi, Mrs. Knight.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Phoebe&#146;s right Frank. I know it&#146;s hard to hear, but it
would&#146;ve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we,
we want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that
what it is?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but not just that.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we
do, none the less&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> None the less.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> None the less. Umm, you&#146;re too young to, to really know what you
want. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it&#146;s a good bye
kiss, that&#146;s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They
both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that
you see what I&#146;m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore
her) Okay, I&#146;ve decided I&#146;m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my
purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s bedroom, he&#146;s listening to the hypnosis tape again.]</p>

<p><b>Hypnosis Tape:</b> Cigarette&#146;s don&#146;t control you. You are a strong,
confident woman, who does not need to smoke. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (He&#146;s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey&#146;s your best friEnd.
You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him
hundreds of dollars worth of pants. </p>

<p>(Chandler wakes up and stares at the tape.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is pouring Rachel coffee.]</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Here you go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> (In his head) <i>Say Rachel, I was wondering if you&#146;d like to go
to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you&#146;d just like
to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.</i></p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! All right, let&#146;s go shoppin&#146;!!</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Um, y'know, before we go ah, there&#146;s something I need to say.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> I&#146;ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But
since you were with Ross, I-I didn&#146;t do anything about it. But, now that you&#146;re
not, I&#146;d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that&#146;s-that&#146;s what
I&#146;m doing, now.</p>

<p>(Gunther gets this hurt expression on his face and goes into the back room)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! Umm....</p>

<p>(She&#146;s interrupted by a loud crash and the sound of braking dishes. Followed
quickly by another crash. Everyone turns and looks at the back room, as Gunther emerges.)</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> I dropped a cup.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments, Pete and Monica are returning from
their date.]</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> ...so y'know, that&#146;s why, within a few years, that voice recognition
is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be
like-like, &#145;Wash my car.&#146; &#145;Clean my room.&#146; It&#146;s not gonna be able
to do any of those things, but it&#146;ll understand what you&#146;re saying.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, this is so great.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Yeah, it was.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly
kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.</p>

<p>(She goes into her apartment and sees Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross sitting there.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello, people who do not live here.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hi! Hello!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I gave you a key for emergencies!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We were out of <i>Doritos</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, how&#146;d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold
separately.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He&#146;s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He&#146;s so
funny, and sooo sweet, and I&#146;m not attracted to him at all!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Still?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Noo!! It&#146;s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he&#146;s like
the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from <i>Sharper Image</i>?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Two.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old
baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table
and exits)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.</p>

<p><b>Monica and Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you.</p>

<p>[Scene: A Theatre, Joey is arriving to rehearse the play he&#146;s in.]</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Joe. How&#146;s it going?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast
member.) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, so you&#146;re playing Adrienne, huh?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I&#146;m Joey Tribianni.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller. </p>

<p>(She goes over to the snack table, and Joey quickly runs over and pours her a cup of
coffee.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So the ah, play&#146;s pretty great, huh?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray&#146;s work. She&#146;s so
brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle
class.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, forget about it. She rocks!</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Where do I know you from?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dr. Drake Remoray. <i>Days of Our Lives</i>. Voted most datable
neurosurgeon by <em>Teen Beat</em>.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> No, that&#146;s not it. So, you&#146;re a soap actor? Well this must be
pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I&#146;ve done plays before. I&#146;m a serious actor.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing!
You&#146;re-you&#146;re-you&#146;re the guy that doesn&#146;t know how to pour milk!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See, I actually <b>can</b> pour milk, but I got you believing that I
couldn&#146;t. Now, see, that&#146;s acting.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Kate:</b> Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, that was real.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe about Mark, as Gunther eavesdrops behind
them.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What, so what are you gonna tell him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I told him I would think about it, but I&#146;m gonna tell him no.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Huh.</p>

<p>(Gunther tries to swoop in to ask Rachel out.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean I think I&#146;d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this
Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I&#146;m
standing there with this charming, cute guy, who&#146;s asking me to go out with him,
which I&#146;m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I&#146;d be cheating on Ross
or something.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you&#146;re not over Ross yet and
you have issues with your father.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t have any issues with my Father.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, so it&#146;s probably just the Ross thing then.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is telling Chandler about Kate.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about
that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and
whenever I can&#146;t do it, they&#146;re all like-like laughing at me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hello.</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow, what-what do you think she wants?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without
me.... a-sucks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s possible. You are very loveable, I&#146;d miss you if I
broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Then be supportive like a guy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I&#146;d miss you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Ross enters, walking very confidently.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You ah, wanted to see me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Ahh, here&#146;s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, y'know, it&#146;s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD&#146;s, just
sort of stuff that you&#146;ve left here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it&#146;s time we-we y'know,
move on. I mean, I mean don&#146;t&#146; you think?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, I do.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this
was a gift?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s still a gift! I got it from the <b>gift shop</b>!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, all right, give me the mug! I&#146;ll keep the mug.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No!! Y'know-y'know don&#146;t do me any favours. In fact, where,
where&#146;s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this
book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I&#146;d like that back too.
Yes, I do.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that
T-shirt!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m just trying to help you, move on.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Petty...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Petty... (goes into her room)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Petty...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Petty...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Petty...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Small...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking
her.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You are so just doing this out of spite.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m-I&#146;m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he
kisses the shirt)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn&#146;t even
fit you anymore!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on
the T-shirt. It&#146;s an old &#145;Frankie says relax&#146; T-shirt, that barely fits
him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don&#146;t mind I&#146;m
gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a
pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the gang minus Rachel and Ross are talking to Pete.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, you&#146;re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And you&#146;re our age. You&#146;re our age.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name
it after yourself.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> What like Pete Dakota?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s not a state Joe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I got to go, so ah, I&#146;ll see you guys later.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&#146;re our age!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head
and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I&#146;m running
out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I
only attracted to guys where there&#146;s no future? Either they&#146;re too old, or
they&#146;re too young, and then there&#146;s Pete who&#146;s-who&#146;s crazy about me,
and who&#146;s absolutely perfect for me, and there&#146;s like zip going on! I mean,
seriously, does it sound like something&#146;s wrong with me?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, kinda.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing for the play.]</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Happy?! Is that what I&#146;m supposed to be Vic? Happy?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, why don&#146;t you tell me what you&#146;re supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell can&#146;t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin&#146;. You look
at me, and it&#146;s nothin&#146;. (He kisses her) Nothing.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Tasty! I&#146;m really starting to feel like you guys have a
history, it&#146;s-it&#146;s nice.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> I have a question about this scene.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Yes?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Well, I don&#146;t understand why Adrienne&#146;s attracted to Victor.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Peel the onion. First of all, he&#146;s good looking.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> I think my character&#146;s gonna need a little bit more of reason than
that.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it&#146;s says so in the script! Y'know
ah, I-I don&#146;t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script
here that you&#146;re a bitch.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> It doesn&#146;t say that in the script.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It does in mine!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Ross are returning from working out.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn&#146;t matter, I
still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing
on the middle part of my head. It&#146;s so annoying. Does it bug you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You bug me.</p>

<p>[Rachel comes out of her apartment, followed by Mark, and they leave on their date,
without saying a word to Ross. Ross is stunned.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is there any chance you didn&#146;t see that?</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching a basketball game, Ross is staring
out the peephole.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can&#146;t just stare through the
peep hole for three hours! You&#146;re gonna get peep eye!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she&#146;d say
no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You didn&#146;t just break up.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, it&#146;s been like three weeks!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I
mean bullets have left guns slower!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,
I&#146;m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can&#146;t, I can&#146;t watch this. (turns away,
then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,
she&#146;s going in.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She&#146;s going in. Wait! He&#146;s going in! He&#146;s going in!! The
door&#146;s closed! I, I can&#146;t see anything but the door closed!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Stop what?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will
do it. I&#146;ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!</p>

<p>(He starts to exit, but Chandler tries to stop him by climbing on his back and grabbing
hold of the foosball table.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No!! You can&#146;t!! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, they must be stopped!</p>

<p align="left"><b>Chandler:</b> I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!
(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly
strong!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I need juice! People need juice!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look man!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> People need juice!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the
door shut with his feet.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Juice, I need...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She&#146;s moving on! Okay, if it&#146;s not this guy, it&#146;s gonna
be somebody else! And unless you&#146;re thinking about subletting my peep hole, <b>you</b>
are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man?
It&#146;s over.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, okay. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s just I miss her so much.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Why do all you&#146;re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. That&#146;s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is
missing, she can be like, &#145;Where&#146;s number 27?!&#146;</p>

<p>(She sits down, and Mark leans over and kisses her. Rachel doesn&#146;t react. He tries
it again, and Rachel jumps back quickly.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know what?</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> No. And I don&#146;t think I&#146;m gonna want to.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can&#146;t do this.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Yep. Yep, that&#146;s what I didn&#146;t want to know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, oh, Mark, I&#146;m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?
I&#146;m just doing it to get back at Ross. I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s not very fair to
you.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am
here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.

<p><b>Monica:</b> (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I&#146;m gonna
say, midget rodeo.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Just tell me the truth.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Umm, y'know, I don&#146;t think, I don&#146;t think I told you
this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Oh, yeah. Wasn&#146;t that like a year ago?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn&#146;t the thing. Umm,
the thing is that, right now I&#146;m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on
me. Y'know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Oh, yeah. I know that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I so wanna be attracted to you.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> But you&#146;re not. Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Y'know what, don&#146;t be. This is not, don&#146;t be, &#145;cause
it&#146;s not so bad.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s not?</p>

<p align="left"><b>Pete:</b> I know I&#146;m no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone
who find attractive, I&#146;m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling
differently.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, um, look I-I don&#146;t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you
seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn&#146;t attracted too.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Yeah, stupidly charming isn&#146;t&#146; it? Well listen let&#146;s, you
wanna get something to eat? &#145;Cause this place is kinda <b>de</b>pressing. (they start
to leave)</p>

<p><b>Spokeswoman:</b> And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> (to Monica) One second.</p>

<p>(He takes the scissors, cuts the ribbon, shakes her hand, posses for the picture, and
leaves.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting in one of the black chairs, and turns
to face the other one.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.
(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a
gunfighter in a Western.) </p>

<p>(Joey enters.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) I wasn&#146;t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing
his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she&#146;s like the
greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, &#145;Oh, I&#146;m so
talented.&#146; and &#145;Oh, I&#146;m so pretty,&#146; and &#145;Ooh, I smell so
good.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think somebody has a crush on somebody.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m talking about you. You big, big freak.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you&#146;re out of your mind.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you
were in a school yard you&#146;d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual
scenarios and stuff huh?!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Theatre, Kate and Joey are rehearsing the same scene as before.] </p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Happy?! Is that what I&#146;m supposed to be Vic? Happy?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, why don&#146;t you tell me what you&#146;re supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell can&#146;t figure it out! I talk to you and it&#146;s nothin&#146;.
You look at me, and nothin&#146;. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we&#146;re gonna pick it up
here, tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Well, that was ah...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Better?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G&#146;night.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah, Kate? </p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You ah, you forgot your shoes.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> (she giggles) I&#146;m probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles some
more)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, listen you ah....</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Hmm?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Umm.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> (leaning in) Kate?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> You ready to go?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> (to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> So umm, I&#146;ll see you tomorrow, huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is in the kitchen chopping vegetables. Chandler and
Phoebe are sitting in the living room.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn&#146;t it
Spiderman? Y&#146;know like Goldman, Silverman...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> &#145;Cause it&#146;s-it&#146;s not his last name.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It isn&#146;t?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it&#146;s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He&#146;s a spider, man.
Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there&#146;s no Gold Man.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rach, how was work?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn&#146;t a chair.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I&#146;m just gonna throw it
out, it&#146;s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Something wrong?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take
a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the black chairs.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay well, he would turn things to gold.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What about things that are already gold?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ahh, his work is done.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, let&#146;s play my game now.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Joey are there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wait a minute, wait. You&#146;re telling me this actress person is the
only woman you ever wanted who didn&#146;t want you back?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it&#146;s like to be you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, you&#146;re really crazy about her, huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we&#146;re on stage I get to-to kiss
her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it&#146;s like
somebody&#146;s ripping out my heart!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&#146;s so <b>great</b> to see you feeling like this!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We were all pretty shaken up about it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, am I missing something though? &#145;Cause I thought death was
something that&#146;s supposed to be sad, in a way.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to
Ross) And I&#146;m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You get the dollhouse.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I get the dollhouse!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, just a barrel.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?! Really?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to
play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, Chandler and her are coming back from lunch.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Sophie!</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> Hey, Rach!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn&#146;t have to walk me all
the way back up here.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that&#146;s-that&#146;s okay, no problem. (He starts to look
around her office.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don&#146;t keep the women&#146;s
lingerie here in the office?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I realise that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)</p>

<p>[Rachel&#146;s boss, Joanna, enters]</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Rachel, I need the <em>Versachi</em> invoice. (to Chandler) Hello! You
don&#146;t work for me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler)
Joanna.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Bing! That&#146;s a great name.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks, it&#146;s ah, Gaelic, for &#145;Thy turkey&#146;s done.&#146;
So ah, I&#146;m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Me too.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Bye, Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> (to Rachel) So ah, what&#146;s wrong with him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, nothing, he&#146;s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice
it anymore.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No!! No! He&#146;s not married, or involved, with anyone!</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I&#146;ll ask him for you, if you want me too?</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something
that Sophie would do?</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> Uh, uh, uh, I am here.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> I know that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is showing off her new dollhouse. It&#146;s a huge
dollhouse, that takes up the entire living room table.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper&#146;s a little faded, that&#146;s okay.
Carpet&#146;s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It&#146;s so beautiful.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know!!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, I&#146;m here, ready to play.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She
removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the
house.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What&#146;s this?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s a dog, every house should have a dog.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Not one that can pee on the roof.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, maybe it&#146;s so big because the house was built on radioactive
waste.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, that&#146;s the ghost for the attic.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t want a ghost.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you&#146;ve got one, because the house
is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient
Indian burial ground? That would never happen.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, obviously you don&#146;t know much about the U.S. government.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I need to talk to you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure, what&#146;s up?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about
you...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin&#146;
out the Chan-Chan man!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you
interested at all?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I&#146;ll do it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she&#146;s gonna love me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the
house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)
Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that&#146;s it, that&#146;s it, all
right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They&#146;re not the right size,
they&#146;re not Victorian, and they just don&#146;t go.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we&#146;re not
welcome in the house of no imagination.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, Pheebs, while we&#146;re hovering around the subject. I just have to
say dinosaurs, they-they don&#146;t go, rrroof!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> The little ones do.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Theatre, Joey and Kate are getting ready to rehearse the play.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Kate!</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Morning.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last
week...</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! (she goes over to him)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was
good, yeah...</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> Hi, oh, I&#146;m Lauren, Kate&#146;s understudy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> I know! I-I&#146;m a big fan of yours.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (looks at her, shocked) What?!</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on
<i>Days of Our Lives</i>.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Get out of here, really?!</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> Absolutely!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah? </p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They gave me the shaft all right.</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> (laughing) Oh, you&#146;re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing
after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a
drink sounds great.</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> Cool! I-I&#146;ll see you then.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> All right, it&#146;s time to act, my talking props. (Both Joey and
Kate just look at each other.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering with her own dollhouse, that she made
herself.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing
the interior.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, what&#146;s this?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay, it&#146;s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides
a doll down the slide)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s very interesting, Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&#146;s this?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come
over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is the coolest house ever!!</p>

<p>(Monica is looking on with a hurt expression on her face.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some
incense)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I would!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!</p>

<p><b>Ross and Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the
house.)</p>

<p><b>Ross and Rachel:</b> Ooohhhh!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)</p>

<p><b>Ross and Rachel:</b> Ahhhh!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey, my Father&#146;s house does that!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there&#146;s nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Of course, I didn&#146;t get to enjoy any of that, because
Joanna&#146;s such a <b>big, dull dud</b>!</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, Joanna&#146;s telling Rachel, her side of the story.]</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Chandler is fantastic!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Oh God, we just clicked! Y&#146;know how people just click? Like he came
by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I....</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Oh, and he&#146;s got such a good heart! Doesn&#146;t he have a good
heart?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I know...</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Oh, I know and he&#146;s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to
call, so put him straight through.</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> Isn&#146;t this great?!</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Don&#146;t spoil it.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on baby, don&#146;t go. Please? What do you say?</p>

<p>[A phone rings.]</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> (answering the phone) Hello. Oh! It&#146;s you. Just ah, just
one-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that
there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, <b>committing
to the moment</b>! (He goes to take the call.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Kate) That guy&#146;s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater
you&#146;re dating.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I&#146;m not interested in her sweater! It&#146;s what&#146;s
underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who
I&#146;m going out with?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> I don&#146;t care. Why, do you want me to care?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do you want me to want you to care?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Do you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> (returning) Okay, I&#146;m afraid to say this, but let&#146;s pick
it up where we left off.</p>

<p>[They resume rehearsing.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on baby, don&#146;t go. Please? What do you say?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> I&#146;ve got no reason to stay. </p>

<p>(Joey grabs her and kisses her.)</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a
terrible play! I&#146;ll see you in the morning. (exits)</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> I can&#146;t believe we go on in, in a week.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, it&#146;s gonna be all right.</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> (to Joey) Hey! So since we&#146;re getting off early, do you want to go
and paint mugs?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> You know! At the place I told you about last night?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,
y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> I&#146;ll see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> G&#146;night. (exits)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Kate) Ah, are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Well, Adrian&#146;s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can&#146;t
just kiss her, he&#146;s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe he could slip her the tongue.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his
waist.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his
stomach!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,
and, and bite her!</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this
raw, animal....</p>

<p>[cut to Joey&#146;s bedroom, Joey and Kate are emerging from under the covers.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Something like that?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Yeah, that&#146;s pretty much what I had in mind.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

happily.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p>(He walks up behind Monica and gives her a big hug and a kiss on the neck.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p>(He walks over behind Ross, thinks about it for a moment, and gives him a big hug.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s a little early to be drinkin&#146;.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohhhhh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You&#146;re kidding?! That&#146;s great!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in
and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming &#145;cause, &#145;cause her eyes keep
going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he&#146;s been
processed by the devil, or something.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering with Rachel) I&#146;m telling ya, Joanna&#146;s got it all
wrong. Okay? All I said was, &#145;This was fun. Let&#146;s do it again sometime.
I&#146;ll give you a call.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you&#146;re going to call her?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s what you say at the end of a date.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You can&#146;t just say, &#145;Nice to meet you, good night?&#146;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> To her face? Look it&#146;s the end of the date, I&#146;m standing
there, I know all she&#146;s waiting for is for me to say &#145;I&#146;ll call her&#146;
and it&#146;s just y'know, comes out. I can&#146;t help it, it&#146;s a compulsion.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on Rach, when a guy says he&#146;s going to call, it doesn&#146;t
mean he&#146;s going to call. Hasn&#146;t it ever happened to you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, they always called.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hmm, bite me.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s office.]</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> (entering) Did he call?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Why?! Why?! He said he&#146;d call. Why hasn&#146;t he called?</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> Maybe he&#146;s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn&#146;t he
called, Rachel? Why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you
are my boss.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well...</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn&#146;t
tell him not to call me, did you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. I...</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you
work for, there are always ways to fix...that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is reading a magazine as Rachel approaches.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Multiple, so many paper cuts.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why hasn&#146;t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don&#146;t understand.
Why? He said he&#146;ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I&#146;m telling you she has flipped out,
she&#146;s gone crazy!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on, this isn&#146;t funny. She thinks it&#146;s my fault that you
haven&#146;t called her. You have to call her!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, you can&#146;t call somebody after this long just to say,
&#145;In case you didn&#146;t notice, I don&#146;t like you!&#146;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well then you&#146;re going to have to take her out again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nooo!! She&#146;s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop
thing in the corner of her eye!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t care! I don&#146;t care! You are going to have to take her
out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it&#146;s actually ended. And, I
don&#146;t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! Fine! But it&#146;s just a lunch date, no more than an
hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don&#146;t want you setting me up with anybody
ever again!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s fine!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s just a lot of big talk, y'know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mon?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (from the bathroom) I&#146;m in the shower!</p>

<p>[He closes the door and walks over to get something from the fridge. He starts to smell
something and turns around to see Phoebe&#146;s dollhouse smoking. He runs over and takes
off the roof to reveal that the dollhouse fire.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, fire! There, there&#146;s a fire! Fire!!</p>

<p>[He tries to blow it out, and obviously, it doesn&#146;t work. He runs over to the sink
to get a glass of water to put out the fire, but since Monica is in the shower the water
pressure is very low and takes a long time to fill the glass. In desperation he takes the
half full glass over and dumps it on the fire, it doesn&#146;t work. He then picks up the
dollhouse and considers bringing it over to the sink, but decides to take it into the
bathroom and use the shower to put it out. He kicks open the door and we hear Monica
scream at the top of her lungs.]</p>

<p>[Scene: The Theatre, Kate is arriving for rehearsal.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you
ah, did you talk to Marshall?</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> About what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know, about what happened with us.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Nooo. And there&#146;s really no reason he should find out, so ah
let&#146;s not make a big deal about it, okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you
can&#146;t tell me last night didn&#146;t mean something to you. I-I was there,
you&#146;re not that good an actress.</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That&#146;s all it
was. Joey, I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry you feel bad, but haven&#146;t you ever sleep with a
women where it meant more to her than it did to you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooo.</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> (entering) Hi, Kate!</p>

<p><b>Kate:</b> Hi, Lauren.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi, Lauren.</p>

<p><b>Lauren:</b> Hi, pig!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are inspecting the damage to the
dollhouse.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that&#146;s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower
massager.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There&#146;s....been a
fire.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What
happened?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the
point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. Did everyone get out okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, the giraffe&#146;s okay. And so is the pirate.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to
remove it.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No Phoebe, don&#146;t look! You don&#146;t want to see what&#146;s under
there!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the
Foster puppets! </p>

<p>(She picks up a charred piece of plastic that once was the Foster puppets, and starts
to break down. Monica goes over and comforts her.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, Chandler and Joanna are returning from their lunch date.
He is telling her about her mascara problem. Rachel is already there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s not a big deal. It&#146;s, just it&#146;s right here,
(points to his eye) and it&#146;s all the time.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Well, thanks again for lunch.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was
pleasant.</p>

<p>(Rachel is slowing trying to leave and let them talk.)</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> It was, wasn&#146;t it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The food there was, was great.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Wasn&#146;t it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So take care.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> You too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, this was great. I&#146;ll give you a call. We should do it again
sometime. (Rachel is disappointed) </p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Great! I&#146;m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sophie&#146;s desk.</p>

<p>(Chandler starts to leave ashamed of himself, but Rachel stops him in the hallway.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Noo! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, I&#146;m sorry. Okay? I&#146;m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, you are going to tell her and you&#146;re going to tell her now.
(She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahhhh&#151;I&#146;m not going to call you.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m-I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry that I said I was
going to when I&#146;m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this
isn&#146;t Rachel&#146;s fault. It&#146;s me. I have serious, serious problems when it
comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And
I&#146;m really sorry, it&#146;s just that this is not, this isn&#146;t going to work out.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Well, this isn&#146;t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I
have to appreciate your honesty.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, o-okay.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> So...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well this is great! I&#146;ll give you a call! We should do it again
sometime!</p>

<p>(Rachel is shocked, and holds her arms out in disbelief.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I&#146;m saying is I should&#146;ve
considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I&#146;ve ah, I&#146;ve
recently learned what&#146;s it like to be on your side of it, and I&#146;m sorry. So, do
you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and
crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs.

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so that&#146;s why the priest threw holy water on me.

<p><b>Anchorwoman:</b> (on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as
traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey is
intrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys
won&#146;t live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a little
baby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.</p>

through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the
door the other way.) I&#146;m okay!! I&#146;m all right!!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Why would you say that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &#145;Cause you&#146;re still into Monica. So you told her there was
somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so &#145;cause you figure oh if you
spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> You&#146;re good. You&#146;re good!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, no, I&#146;m fairly intuitive and psychic. It&#146;s a substantial
gift.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Listen, can you promise me that you won&#146;t tell her though?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Thanks a lot.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No I&#146;m serious. I mean I&#146;m intuitive, but my memory sucks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to
determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can&#146;t tell, what ever it was went
back in too quickly.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, anyway, I got to go change, I&#146;m ah, meeting some of the cast
for drinks.</p>

morning trying to get her back to sleep?</p>

and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
Well I don&#146;t think so mister!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And you don&#146;t think taking care of our chick is work?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this
chick, we&#146;ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know, maybe we weren&#146;t ready to have a chick.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;ll take her back tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do you think we&#146;ll get our three bucks back?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in
like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This
blue suit, or this brown one?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the
blue one.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really? (Joey gives him a &#145;Like I would know&#146; look)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to take some aspirin.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble
opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! That aspirin dance really works!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God, is that still...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m fine, I&#146;m fine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No you&#146;re not.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes I am! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look, I&#146;m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes)
Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)
Whoa-whoa!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a
doctor! Okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. I have <b>got</b> to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses
house. It&#146;s a very big deal, there&#146;s a lot of people there I have to meet.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And I&#146;m sure you&#146;re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I&#146;m
Rachel Green. It&#146;s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands
with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,
you probably have a broken rib!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it&#146;ll still be broken
then.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look, either help me or go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine. I&#146;ll go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you
help me first?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (He checks his watch) Sure. I&#146;ll help you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out
of a VCR?!</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</p>

<p></b>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s bedroom, Rachel is trying to put on eye liner with her left
hand, as Ross is setting out her shoes.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!
Would you please, help me with this too?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He
doesn&#146;t like how it tastes.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (taking the brush back) Okay. Let&#146;s use this brush. (Hands him
another one.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. This stuff? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.
Okay? Just sweep it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-ho!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! That&#146;s just poking me in the eye!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sorry, I&#146;m sorry. Close, close, close...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, just sweep it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sweeping...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she
has a black eye.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, now make it even, &#145;cause we don&#146;t...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We don&#146;t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.</p>

<p>(Of course it&#146;s too late for that.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. No, y'know you don&#146;t, you don&#146;t wear enough of this. (Rachel
is shocked) What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Since when, since when do you think I don&#146;t wear enough of this?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I, close your eyes, I just think you&#146;re gonna like this a little
better, &#145;cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Blow it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (blows it) Sorry. &#145;Cause umm, I think this will make you a little
more sophisticated.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sophisticated like a hooker?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But I can&#146;t tell you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, but wouldn&#146;t it be easier if you had to tell me something
that you could tell me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn&#146;t tell,
and I swore to like all my gods.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Does it have to do with Joey?</p>

<p>(She turns and looks in the mirror, and it&#146;s way, way over done. She looks like
she has two black eyes.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yep?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure, I&#146;ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t want you to see me naked!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel, I&#146;ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you
naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but that was different. Y&#146;know? I mean, we were, we were
going out then, now I think it&#146;s weird.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! Stop that!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on! I don&#146;t want you thinking of me like that any more!</p>

the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, I&#146;m sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh!

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sees he&#146;s watching <i>Baywatch</i>) Ohhh. (sees he still has the
chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store
today.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I did! But the store wouldn&#146;t take her back! So then I took her
to the shelter, and you know what I found out? </p>

<p>(Joey wants to know, but Chandler doesn&#146;t want to discuss it by the chick, so he
and Joey move over to the windows and away from the chick.) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If they can&#146;t find a home for her, they kill her! And I&#146;m
not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, good, good, good, &#145;cause, good, &#145;cause I was kinda having
second thoughts too. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. And it&#146;s not just chicks y'know? It&#146;s all kinds of
other animals!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks, I&#146;m glad you see it that way.</p>

really nice.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I&#146;m okay with that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one
who hurts you. That&#146;s why I can&#146;t take this job.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And well, we probably shouldn&#146;t see each other anymore. I&#146;m
sorry.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Okay, yeah. I mean... If that&#146;s, if that&#146;s really what you want,
okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, bye. </p>

<p>(She kisses him on the cheek, and he kisses her back on the mouth.)</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I&#146;m sorry things didn&#146;t work out...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, why didn&#146;t you tell me that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Eh, &#145;cause I knew that if I told you, you&#146;d make me go, and I

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, kinda. It&#146;s this woman from work. I hope that won&#146;t be too
weird. Will it, Rach?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone
myself, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sorry, I&#146;m so sorry, I will pay you back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And yet, she&#146;s still not hanging up the phone.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I think I broke it. But that&#146;s all right, here&#146;s the
number you can call.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (sarcastic) Oh.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are playing with the duck and the
chick.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could
call it Chuck.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Or... Dick.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing
myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Was it like a sneeze only better?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (with a disgusted look) What was it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not
visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
(starts to take off his pants)</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Whoa!!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his
thing.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump
back.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go
see a&#133; </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're
doing and stops, the guys are stunned)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ahhh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, right.</p>

<p>(Rachel backs out with a confused look on her face.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Rachel are there, as Phoebe enters with her
date.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I
play my music. (points to the stage)</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> Good deal.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Vince is a fireman.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> 98 hot saves, highest in the force.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to
an even hundred. </p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> (dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're right, I know.</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> (to Phoebe) Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. (kisses her) See you
Saturday. (leaves)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (watches him leave)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that
Kindergarten teacher.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two
guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin',
field-playin' juggler.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So Pheebs, do they know about each other?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know'
face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey guys!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p>(He goes over and sits down at the counter, all depressed.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (going over to him) Well?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally
benign.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well what is it?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin...
abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify
it, he was reluctant to remove it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there
with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean
not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross.
And then people would be like, &quot;Awww, he's got a Ross.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!</p>

<p>[cut to Phoebe and Rachel as Monica returns from the bathroom]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Pete's breaking up with me.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from
Atlanta, <b>we</b> need to talk.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something
bad.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.</p>

<p>[Scene: A Street, Phoebe is walking with her second date, Jason.]</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> ...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty
cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught
on fire) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> Whoa!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (stopping him) No! No! </p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> No, no?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.
(hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out
of here!</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> W-w-w-wait! Why?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she
drags him away)</p>

<p>[Scene: A Doctor's Office, Ross is having his thing looked at by Dr. Rhodes.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill
third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rhodes:</b> Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.
(Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rhodes:</b> Well that's not a third nipple.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rhodes:</b> First of all, it's on your ass.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well then, what is it?!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rhodes:</b> Wait a minute, hold it. (He goes to the door and opens it.) Johnson!
Will you come in here a moment?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Johnson:</b> I'm with Hamilton!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rhodes:</b> He's good with rear things, bring him in too.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know
what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I <b>won't</b> water his plants.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water
his plants. If y'know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering with Rachel) &#133;and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,
always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (disgusted) Uh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So Pheebs, pick one of them.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. Which one do you like more?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's
so burly, he's sooo <b>very</b> burly. (giggles)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well sensitive is important, pick him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh sure, go with the sissy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Jason is not a sissy!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.</p>

<p>[Scene: Dr. Rhodes's Office, a rather large group of doctors has now gathered to take a
look at Ross's thing. Ross is none too pleased with the developments, he has a disgusted
look on his face.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know I have dinner plans!!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Rhodes:</b> Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and
gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm
stumped. </p>

<p>(He removes the blanket covering the thing.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Whoa. (they all lean in to get a closer look, Ross isn't pleased)</p>

<p>[Scene: Pete's apartment, Monica is there to water the plants, and is showing the gang
around.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights
turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights!
Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, and the dimmer switch.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be
here, so please, do <b>not</b> touch anything.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God, that is the nicest kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a
great day.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get
out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically
answers it)</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Monica? (the gang ducks and hides)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I guess that's how.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Hey Monica, how's it going.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh it&#146;s umm, good! It's umm, it&#146;s good, just here watering the
plants.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> (standing up) Hey Pete.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi, how ya doing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so
I know, is it good news or bad news.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I
have another call. (clicks his remote) (to his other call) Hey, how's it going?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no-no-no, it's still me.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. (to other caller) Yeah.
(listens) Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. (pause) Monica? You. I'm
gonna have to call you back.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Okay, I love you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I love you.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> I love you, love you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, what do you thing the good news is?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000
dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the
good news is?</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!</p>

<p>(Pete's computer automatically calls Mom, Pete's Mom.)</p>

<p><b>Pete's Mom:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And that's Pete's Mom. </p>

<p>(The gang quickly hides again.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is returning from Pete&#146;s.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could
be, &#147;Look how much money we&#146;ve got!&#148; Y'know, I mean you could put, you
could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place
settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it&#146;ll be dry, but people
<b>will</b> like it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Would you stop? We&#146;ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean
we don&#146;t even know if he&#146;s gonna propose.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He&#146;s not like other people, on your
first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that&#146;s like a third or fourth date
kinda thing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well if-if that&#146;s what it is, then it&#146;s-it&#146;s crazy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica&#146;s right. We&#146;re talking about getting married here. Okay?
She-she can&#146;t just rush into this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!</p>

<p>(Joey laughs, Ross glares at him, and Joey stops.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so you&#146;re going with the teacher, huh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it&#146;s just Jason&#146;s so
sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it&#146;s just better than
having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking
about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Good luck!</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at
her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it&#146;d be like to catch the money bouquet. </p>

<p>[Scene: A Fire House, Phoebe has gone to break up with Vince.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?</p>

<p><b>Fireman:</b> Oh sure. Vince?!</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> Yo!! (slides down that pole that fire station&#146;s have)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! I didn&#146;t know you guys actually used those. </p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> So, what&#146;s up?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, wow. This-this isn&#146;t gonna be easy. Umm, I don&#146;t think we
should see each other anymore.</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> Uh-huh. G-good deal.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> No-no it&#146;s okay. It&#146;s just that ah, I thought we had something
pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to,
and&#133; (starts choking up) That there&#146;s so much in me I have to share with you
yet.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, I didn&#146;t&#133;</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> (starting to cry) I&#146;m sorry, I can&#146;t talk. I&#146;m gonna go
write in my journal. (walks away)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Ross, and Monica are there.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Ross) I&#146;m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing,
you should go to my herbal guy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don&#146;t want to make it
savory.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they
tell their friends about it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist&#146;s card and leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hi! Okay, don&#146;t be mad at me, but I couldn&#146;t
resist.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Brides magazines?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, and I know that you&#146;d say no if he asked you, but I&#146;m
sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the
picture.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both
look at her.) Like for clubbing. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in
bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine
shut in amazement.) I know it&#146;s a little sudden, and it&#146;s a little rushed, and
it&#146;s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn&#146;t mean I
can&#146;t. Right? I mean I&#146;m-I&#146;m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the
same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God. (starting to cry) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You didn&#146;t break up with that fireman?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he&#146;s
incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal
drawings that he drew of me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, well he&#146;d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access
to a lot of charcoal.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So then, are you going to dump Jason?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and&#133; Okay so
Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so&#146;s Vince (holds up one finger on
her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince
side) So&#133; It&#146;s really just about the math.</p>

<p>[Scene: Jason&#146;s apartment, Phoebe has gone to break up with Jason.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (knocks on the door) Jason?</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> Yeah, come on in.</p>

<p>(She goes in, and sees Jason without his shirt. It turns out that he has a great body
too, and is at a loss for words.)</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything
wrong?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nah-ha!</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe&#146;s Herbal Guy&#146;s office, Ross is there about his thing. Ross is
looking around the exam room, and he goes over to a large bank of drawers, pulls one out
and almost spills it as the herbalist, Guru Saj, enters.]</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> You must be Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> I am Guru Saj. (takes the drawer back and replaces)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen, I got to tell you I&#146;ve-I&#146;ve never been to a guru before,
so...</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I&#146;ve attended some of
the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let&#146;s take a look at this
skin abnormality of yours. (motions to the table) Come on, have a seat. (looks at it) Eeh,
huh. As I suspected, it&#146;s a koondis!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What&#146;s a koondis?</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> I don&#146;t know, what&#146;s a koondis with you? (starts laughing as
if that joke was funny, Ross only looks at him, and he stops) Please, lie down! I&#146;ve
got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I guess it&#146;s worth a try.</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> Oh sure, we should see results&#151;Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
(quickly wipes it off)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! What?!</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> We appear to have angered it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We?! We angered it?!</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> Oh, I think I see the problem. And I&#146;m afraid we&#146;re gonna
have to use a much stronger tool. (Ross gives him a &#145;What?&#146; look) Love.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh God!</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> (He starts moving his hands around in circles above the thing.) Ross,
there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ow!! </p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> Oops.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What was, what was that?</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> Well it&#146;s gone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! How&#146;s that?</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> It got caught on my watch.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! (congratulates him)</p>

<p>[Scene: Pete&#146;s apartment, Pete and Monica are coming back from a date.]</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Lights. (The lights turn on, once again they&#146;re too bright.) Uh,
romantic lights. (The lights dim.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooh, nice.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Well ah, I&#146;ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my
life&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> And I feel like I&#146;ve conquered the business world, and I feel like
I&#146;ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in
the world.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> There&#146;s one thing missing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What&#146;s that?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> It&#146;s time for me to conquer the physical world.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (not sure of herself)</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Monica, I want to become (pause) the Ultimate Fighting Champion.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You wanna what?!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It&#146;s the most
intense physical competition in the world, it&#146;s banned in 49 states!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and
Brazilian street fighting, I&#146;ve even had my own octagon training ring designed.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you
close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> My parents will be so happy.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe&#146;s singing, Vince is also there.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) &#147;Crazy underwear, creepin&#146; up my butt. (Jason
enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear&#133;&#148; (In
her head) <i>Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep
playing. You&#146;ll get through this; you&#146;ll be fine.</i> (She tries to continue the
song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as
gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me
after the show.</p>

<p>(They all applaud her.)</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> (going up to her) Hey. I was&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> I was passin&#146; by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it&#146;s
kinda cool seeing you up there. (kisses her)</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> (running over) Whoa! Hey-hey! What&#146;s going on here? Who is this guy?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&#146;t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, okay, I&#146;ve-I&#146;ve been dating both of you, and it&#146;s
been really horrible. &#145;Cause y'know it&#146;s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I
like you both, and I, and I didn&#146;t know how to chose, so... I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m
just, I&#146;m terrible, I&#146;m a terrible person. I&#146;m terrible.</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it&#146;s okay. I mean we never said this was
exclusive.</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven&#146;t been going out <b>that</b> long.
Come on, we haven&#146;t even slept together yet. Huh.</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> You haven&#146;t?</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> You have?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> (to Phoebe) I-I can&#146;t believe this! You-you&#146;ve slept with him?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.</p>

<p><b>Jason:</b> Y'know Phoebe, I&#146;m gonna make this real easy for you. (walks out)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Vince) Well, that could&#146;ve been really awkward.</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> You made him a candle light dinner in the park?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I&#146;m gonna do that for you.</p>

<p><b>Vince:</b> Uh yeah, I can&#146;t believe I ever went out with somebody who would
actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. (walks out)</p>

Dick?</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> (entering) Hello, I am Guru Saj-(sees the duck)-Whoa!! (to Joey)
That&#146;s supposed to be a duck right? &#145;Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, yeah. He&#146;s got a, he&#146;s got a really bad cough, and our
vet, he can&#146;t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?</p>

<p><b>Guru Saj:</b> Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do you think that there&#146;s a town in Missouri or some place called
Sample? And ah, as you&#146;re driving into town there&#146;s-there&#146;s like a sign,
and it says &#147;You&#146;re in Sample.&#148; (He says it like urine sample.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How&#146;d it go with Pete?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Tell us!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You&#146;re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...</p>

<p>[Two guys walk over and interrupt her. They&#146;re both names you&#146;ve already
heard. One&#146;s Billy Crystal. Yes, <b>that</b> Billy Crystal from <i>City Slickers</i>.
The other one is Robin Williams. Yes, <b>that</b> Robin Williams from <i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i>.]</p>

<p><b>Billy Crystal:</b> I&#146;m sorry. Ex-excuse us. I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s a little
crowded. Do you mind if we... (motions to the couch)</p>

<p><b>Robin Williams:</b> Yeah, could you scooch?</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> Yeah, move over just a little bit. </p>

<p>(Rachel, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey all scooch over to let them sit down.)</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> Keep on scooching.</p>

<p>[cut to Monica telling the gang about what happened at Pete&#146;s]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...</p>

<p>(Robin interrupts her again by complaining loudly to Billy as the camera cuts to them.)</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> Why? Why?! What&#146;s wrong with me?!</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> What&#146;s the matter?</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> I have a feelin&#146;... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.</p>

<p>(The gang is now eaves dropping in on the conversation, and is shocked.)</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> How do you know?</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> Well y'know, he&#146;s got access.</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> Y'know it&#146;s that feeling you get, y'know?</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> Like when you go bowling and you know you&#146;re in somebody else&#146;s
shoes?</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> That&#146;s the one.</p>

<p>[cut back to the gang.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, so, so you went to Pete&#146;s...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Robin is speaking loudly again) I...</p>

<p>[cut to Billy and Robin]</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> Why is this happening to me?! I don&#146;t know, maybe it&#146;s my
wound.</p>

<p>[cut to the gang]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> So it&#146;s-it&#146;s not heeled yet?</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> No-no, it&#146;s ooozing, oozing. (to Rachel) Could you pass me the
cream? Is there any&#151;Oh, there&#146;s the cream.</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and
nobody else.</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> What is it, Tim?</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> It&#146;s me, I&#146;ve been sleeping with your wife.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Billy) So you&#146;re the gynaecologist?</p>

<p><b>Billy:</b> (to Joey) Hey, I&#146;m trying to have a private conversation! Is that
okay?!</p>

<p><b>Robin:</b> (starting to cry) Ooh, (to Rachel) Can I have a napkin, please? Could you
please hand me a napkin? (Rachel tries to grab one, but is to slow for his tastes.) Would
you--Give me this thing (grabs the napkin holder from her.) all right!! Enough! (to Billy)
And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! (gets up to leave) Nada!! No more! You
are a <b>bastard</b> for doing this!! (Billy follows him) Get away from me!!</p>

<p>[cut to the gang, they&#146;re all stunned]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (pause) I have no idea.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or
should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no-no oh, keep your name, don&#146;t take his name.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He didn&#146;t ask me to marry him.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Ohh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well then <b>definately</b> don&#146;t take his name.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He wanted to tell me he&#146;s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting
competition thingy.</p>

<p><b>The Guys:</b> Pete?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why?! What is it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t know exactly. It&#146;s-it&#146;s sorta like wrestling.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (intrigued) Oh?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but without the costumes.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (disappointed) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And it&#146;s not fake, it&#146;s totally brutal.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it&#146;s two guys in a ring, and the rules are:
&#147;They&#146;re <b>are</b> no rules.&#148;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So you can like, bite, and pull people&#146;s hair and stuff?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What&#146;s fish hooking?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh, what&#146;s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross&#146;s
mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic)
Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s office, he is just finishing a meeting with his boss.]</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> So thanks for the warm welcome. It&#146;s good to have you guys on my
team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let&#146;s go out there and get
&#145;em! Huh? And remember, there is no &#145;I&#146; in team.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, but there&#146;s two in martini, soo everybody <b>back</b> to my
office.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> (to Chandler) You! Chuckles! What&#146;s your name?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh it&#146;s Bing, sir. I&#146;m sorry , I was just ah...</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. (Chandler starts to
leave) This team is about hard work, but it&#146;s also about having fun. Good to have you
aboard Bing! (smacks him on the butt, and Chandler leaves shocked.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is making reservations.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) That&#146;s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank
you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like
it was no big deal.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeesh, what&#146;d you do about it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I didn&#146;t do anything. I didn&#146;t want to be the guy who
has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I gotta tell ya, I think it&#146;s okay to be that guy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, maybe it&#146;s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football
players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt) </p>

<p>(Ross throws his hands out in a &#147;What are you doing?&#148; gesture)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t understand guys, I mean I-I would
never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin&#146; her boob.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head
in between &#145;em.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, can we please go eat?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. What are we getting?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Chandler) Anything but stew.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right so, Chandler, from now on, don&#146;t give your boss a chance to
get you. Y'know just ah, don&#146;t turn your back to him.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you
could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to
smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that
would smell bad?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?</p>

<p>(Monica, Ross, Chandler, and Joey exit.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I
set Ross up on a date?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, ah with who?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute,
and now that you two aren&#146;t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if
you&#146;re not cool with it...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She&#146;s yeah,
like, average height, medium build, bald...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! (laughs) That&#146;s fine.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)</p>

<p>[Scene: A Gym, Pete is training for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, with his
trainer, Hoshi.]</p>

<p><b>Hoshi:</b> You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I
call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I told you, we&#146;re adding new operators all the time. Could we
concentrate on my training?</p>

<p><b>Hoshi:</b> It&#146;s just hard when I know I have e-mail <b>I can&#146;t get</b>! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey.</p>

<p><b>Hoshi:</b> All right, on the table. (Pete gets on the table for his rubdown)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this
ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don&#146;t want
you to get hurt, &#145;cause I kinda like you.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Oh, believe me, I don&#146;t want to get hurt either. I&#146;m being smart
about this. See these guys? They&#146;re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here
used to be a paid assassin. (Hoshi yells at him in Chinese) A house painter! He used to be
a house painter.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Promise me you&#146;ll be careful.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I promise.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, are we still on for tonight?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, good, &#145;cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout
of our own...</p>

<p><b>Hoshi:</b> No! No boom-boom before big fight!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How &#145;bout just a boom?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there with Bonnie, as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft
pretzel from one of the kids from <i>Fame</i>. Ready to go to the movies?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You&#146;re
Bonnie?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I can show you an ID if you want?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, I&#146;m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I
saw you.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, that must be it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Thanks! You too.</p>

<p>(Phoebe starts to leave, Rachel slowly follows, shocked about how good Bonnie looks
now.)</p>

<p>[cut to outside of Central Perk]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, she was bald, she&#146;s not now.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How could you not tell me that she has hair?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&#146;t know, I hardly ever say that about people.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well I&#146;m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.
I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got <b>all</b> over head!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, maybe it won&#146;t work out. Maybe Ross won&#146;t like her
personality.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why, does she have a bad personality?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, Bonnie&#146;s the best!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s office, Chandler is bent over getting some water as his boss
approaches.]</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Read
your Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slides
over making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. (Chandler
goes over) Wham! (slaps him on the butt) Good one. That was a good one. (to a couple of
Chandler&#146;s co-workers) Keep at it team. (goes into his office)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to his co-workers) What is with him?</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> With him? You&#146;re is favourite, you&#146;re his guy!</p>

<p><b>Stevens:</b> We never get smacked.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that&#146;s not true, he-he smacked you once.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.</p>

<p><b>Stevens:</b> I&#146;m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting
Dartmouth in the fall.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> (coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth
sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No sir.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> There you go. (smacks him on the butt)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Ultimate Fighting Championship, Ross and Monica are there watching Pete.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (walking up with this <b>huge</b> tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> God Ross, what is that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it&#146;s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents,
plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!</p>

<p><b>Announcer:</b> From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting
Championship debut! He&#146;s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and
Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!</p>

<p>[Pete enters with his entourage all pumped up, and Ross and Monica are the only ones
who stand up and cheer.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I love you, Pete!!!</p>

<p><b>Announcer:</b> And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He&#146;s a 300
pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!! </p>

<p>(The crowd goes wild, and Ross is the only one boo-ing him.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy&#146;s pretty huge!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Don&#146;t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent&#146;s strength
and weight against him.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.</p>

<p>(Pete and Monica kiss, and Monica mouths &#147;I love you.&#148; to him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right! You go get him! Let&#146;s go!</p>

<p><b>Referee:</b> Here we go gentlemen, here we go! (to Tank Abbott) Are you ready? (He
nods, and takes out his teeth) (to Pete) Are you ready? (Pete nods, &#147;Yes.&#148;)
Let&#146;s get it on!!</p>

<p>(They both rush each other. Tank picks Pete up and carries him over and slams him into
the fence surrounding the ring.)</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Uh-oh.</p>

<p>(Tank carries Pete over to the other side of the ring, and we see both Ross and Monica
wince in pain.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The Arena, after the fight. Monica is walking up to a defeated Pete.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey! (she sits down next to him) It&#146;s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell
you how proud I am of you.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant &#147;You suck!&#148;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now
you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> What, look back?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, you&#146;re not gonna get going are you?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, no. But...</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Well I&#146;m not gonna stop until I&#146;m the Ultimate Fighting
Champion.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think
it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad&#146;s garage,
there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I
learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You didn&#146;t know that already?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Look, I&#146;m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have
affected my concentration.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. That-that was the problem.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's balcony, Ross and Phoebe are grilling some burgers and hot
dogs.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (joining them) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! How long until Pete&#146;s fight?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, about five minutes. Right now they&#146;re interviewing his
opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hot dog?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I&#146;m really nervous. (Ross gives
her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn&#146;t expecting to like her at all,
I mean I actually wasn&#146;t expecting to like anyone right now, but she&#146;s really
terrific.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, that&#146;s too bad!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I-I&#146;m saying I liked her.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, I think she&#146;s great. Okay? We&#146;re going out again.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (joining them) Hey! Which one&#146;s my turkey burger?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight&#146;s starting!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, we&#146;ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to
slap you again today?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it&#146;s gonna be
okay, because as of tomorrow I&#146;m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as
planned, my butt will be smack free.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sticking his head out the window) Fight&#146;s over!</p>

<p>(Chandler, Ross, and Phoebe all stop dead in their tracks at the news.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s office, Chandler is confronting his boss about the butt
smacking thing. His boss is writing on a white board.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> (turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I ah, I didn&#146;t do them.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Oh, you forgot?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no I just ah, didn&#146;t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a
couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don&#146;t deserve any praise,
verbal or otherwise.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi
Bridge never looked smaller. (laughs) That&#146;s okay, you&#146;re still my number one
guy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Doug!!</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express
yourself.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I
gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no. It-it&#146;s not about the swearing, it&#146;s more about ah,
the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Oh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, and don&#146;t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It&#146;s
just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it&#146;s making all
the other guys jealous.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing!
You&#146;re okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (he starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out)
Ahhhhhhh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)</p>

<p>[Scene: The street outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are talking and walking.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or
inside his shower drain?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look,
it&#146;s Ross and that girl.</p>

<p>(We see Ross and Bonnie laughing and having a good time.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It&#146;s a line
of ants! They&#146;re working as a team!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe! (goes back to the window)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is
breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let&#146;s go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them.
Okay that&#146;s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that&#146;s
what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no! That really is nothing, she is <b>very</b> sexually aggressive.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now
he loves her, he&#146;s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You said it was okay!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You said she was bald!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, we can&#146;t, we just can&#146;t just let it happen! Okay, we
have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her
head! You owe me one bald girl!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don&#146;t get it.
Aren&#146;t you the one that decided that you didn&#146;t want to be with Ross?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (quietly) Yes.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well isn&#146;t he your friend? Don&#146;t you want him to be happy?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I just y'know, I didn&#146;t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff.
Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb) </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, we killed them all.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! </p>

<p>(They both jump up and wipe off their butts.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A locker room, Pete is in a full upper-body cast. Monica enters, sees him, and
gasps. Pete tries to turn around, and winces in pain.]</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> It&#146;s okay, it&#146;s not as bad as it looks, it&#146;s a precaution.
Ah, I&#146;m not supposed to move my spine.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Please tell me you&#146;re stopping now.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I&#146;m fine! I&#146;d fight tonight, if they&#146;d let me. (stands up
and starts swinging his arms) See this circle I&#146;m marking off here? This is my zone
of terror.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I can&#146;t until I&#146;m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I&#146;m
telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or
Superman. Now, I&#146;m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at
this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!! </p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right
forearm, and a severely bruised Adam&#146;s Apple, but that really hurt.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt
yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you&#146;re gonna have to do it
without me.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Well if you&#146;re asking me to quit, then you&#146;re asking me to be
someone I&#146;m not. I&#146;ve got to do this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Then I&#146;ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Mon-Monica?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Could you leave a note? &#145;Cause I&#146;m on a lot of pain killers now,
and I don&#146;t know if I&#146;ll remember this tomorrow. (She leaves.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s office, he is just finishing up a meeting with his boss and the
rest of his team.]</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> So, in conclusion, the lines all go up (points to the chart), so I&#146;m
happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. (They start to leave) Phil! Nice job. (smacks him
on the butt) Stevens! Way to go! (smacks him on the butt) Joel-burg, you maniac! I love
ya! (smacks him on the butt) (Chandler walks up) Bing! Good job, couldn&#146;t have done
it without ya. (he shakes his hand)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><b>Stevens:</b> (coming back in) Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by
accident.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him on
the butt) (to Chandler) Well, what about you? You&#146;re not feeling left out or anything
are ya?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. No, not at all, that&#146;s-that&#146;s ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don&#146;t you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Now get on out of here, you! (smacks him on the butt)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is watching Pete fight on TV. Monica is hiding in
the kitchen, not watching.]</p>

<p><b>TV Announcer:</b> Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he&#146;s
just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I can&#146;t watch this. (turns her eyes away)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Check it out, he&#146;s winning! (to Monica) Pete&#146;s winning!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-o-o!!</p>

<p><b>TV Announcer:</b> Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his
favourite area.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh! Oh! (they all recoil in horror)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, if that&#146;s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn&#146;t
want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Ohh!! (they all start pointing at the screen)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe is there. Bonnie is telling them of her
sex-capades.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on
that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don&#146;t know, we were, we were making out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.</p>

<p>[cut to Rachel and Monica at the counter.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else
but sex?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, she was listing the countries she&#146;s done it in.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I think we all learned something.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!
(She hands Chandler a picture) That&#146;s my Mom&#146;s writing! Look.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation
1965.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know what that means?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That you&#146;re actually 50?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no, that&#146;s not, that&#146;s not <b>me</b> Phoebe, that&#146;s
her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and
Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That is so cool.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories
about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and
she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! Yeah, we can!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> (to Ross) Shoot! I can&#146;t go, I have to work!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s too bad.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So great! Okay! Tomorrow we&#146;re gonna drive out to Montauk.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Bonnie had sex there!</p>

<p>(Rachel turns and gives him a look, and Joey quickly apologises.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are waiting for Phoebe to arrive with
the cab.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am
I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&#146;re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (sarcastic) Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I&#146;ll be your boyfriend.</p>

<p>(At that suggestion Monica starts laughing.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah right.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why is that so funny?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You made a joke right? So I laughed.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, no. You&#146;re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so we&#146;ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically
y'know, I mean say we weren&#146;t friends, say it&#146;s a blind date. I show up at your
door, and I&#146;m like (in a fake voice) &#147;Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.&#148;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well I&#146;d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, it&#146;s just my luggage.</p>

<p>(Phoebe drives up.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler, Monica, and Joey:</b> Hey!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who
knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I wasn&#146;t talking about his karma.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (approaching) Hey! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey-hey, check out the hat!</p>

<p>(She is wearing this <b>giant</b> straw hat, the brim on it must be at least, <b>least</b>
foot wide.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did
experiments on me! I can&#146;t have children!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Seriously, where did you get the hat?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross gave it to me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I think she looks good.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, thank you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that
hats are back.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And this time, they&#146;ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.</p>

<p>[Scene: At the Beach, it&#146;s raining cats and dogs as the gang arrives. Chandler and
Monica are taking shelter under Rachel&#146;s hat.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Go, go, go!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!</p>

<p>(They get inside and notice on small problem.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oy!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What&#146;s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the
floor, which is covered in sand)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe Sr. house, she is a real estate agent and is trying to sell a house over
the phone. By the way, it&#146;s still raining outside.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Well, yes, it&#146;s kind&#146;ve an unusual house. It has umm, three
beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (at the door) Knock, knock, knock.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> (on phone) Ah, oh, hang on a second. (to Phoebe) Come in, come in.
(on phone) All right, so think about it, and call me back. (hangs up)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Ahh, yes.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi Phoebe Abott, I&#146;m your best friends daughter!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> You&#146;re Erwin&#146;s daughter?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the picture)
Lily, from high school. Remember?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She
named me after you I guess.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There&#146;s Frank. (points to the picture.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That&#146;s my Dad, that&#146;s Frank! Yeah!
I&#146;m sorry I&#146;m getting all flingy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Take it easy--if you want, there&#146;s cookies on the counter, or,
or--sangria! (jumps up) I can make sangria!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I&#146;ve been,
I&#146;ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Oh no, I-I&#146;m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after
high school.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents.
Everything.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname
for the three of us.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, what? What was it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. (Phoebe notices a picture on the
fridge, takes it, and puts it in her pocket.) Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened,
that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (happily) Yeah, no, it was great.</p>

<p>[Scene: The beach house, it&#146;s still raining. Chandler is building a sand castle,
Rachel is doing Monica&#146;s nails, and they&#146;re all drinking margaritas, obviously
bored.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> No, no!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you crazy?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it&#146;s like a law!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Monica) Allll done!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aww, thank you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, who&#146;s next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when she
comes to Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a &#147;Please?&#148; look.) No way! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on, please?! I&#146;m boredddd! You let me do it once before.</p>

<p>(Ross shoots Joey a look, who shoots Chandler a look, who gives Joey an &#147;Oh my
God.&#148; look back.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah well, if ah, if that&#146;s the rule this weekend... (She gets up)
No!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! (she starts creeping up on him)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Get away!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just once! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Stay away!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Take it like a man, Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (he gets up and starts to run away from her) No! (in his escape attempt he
crushes Chandler&#146;s sand castle) No!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Big bullies!!</p>

<p>(Ross dives over the couch, Rachel goes the other way, and lands up top of him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!</p>

<p>(They get into a wrestling match, that ends with Ross making Rachel paint her forehead
with the nail polish. They both end up lying next to each other, stop, and look at each
other for a moment.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Oh, hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, so, how are we doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bored and bored!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Noo!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Phoebe) So what&#146;s Phoebe like?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m kind, caring, and sweet. What&#146;s Monica like?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh well, where is he?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn&#146;t heard from him
on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows Monica)! Isn&#146;t this
what he would look like now?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>The Guys:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, why would she lie to you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&#146;t know, but we&#146;re having dinner tomorrow night, so I
figured, she&#146;s gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to,
buy me presents, I don&#146;t know! So, you&#146;re all bored?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Ohh!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I&#146;m gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you,
whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we <b>have</b> to do
it. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, all right. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Fan out! Fan out!</p>

<p>(They do so, and Phoebe gets in the middle, closes her eyes, and starts spinning in a
circle.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh, y'know we could just do this. (She stops at
Chandler)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (jumping in triumph) OH YES!!!!!</p>

<p>[cut to later]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Strip Happy Days Game?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well, I couldn&#146;t find any cards, so it was either this or Strip
Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.</p>

<p>(Monica rolls, and Ross goes first.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, (reading the card) Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool
points. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off
one item of clothing. It hasn&#146;t happened yet, but we&#146;re all very excited.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, come on! (blows on the dice) Daddy needs a new pair of
electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! (They all look at
him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take
Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me
five, and let&#146;s see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip
poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.</p>

<p>The Girls: Woo-hooooo!!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, relax. It&#146;s just a shoe.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Wooooo!!!!</p>

<p>[cut to later in the game]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnold&#146;s, collect
three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey&#146;s boxers!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, take &#145;em off!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Actually, y'know it&#146;s kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on,
and give you all a peek at the good stuff?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (getting up) All right, I&#146;m gonna make more margaritas! (She pours
the rest of the pitcher into Ross&#146;s glass.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m just making margaritas.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think I&#146;ll help her out. (She gets up to go over and help Rachel,
and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is going on here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You painting his toenails?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chasing him all around the room?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, please?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He&#146;s totally flirting with you too.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (pause) He is, isn&#146;t he? I don&#146;t know, I don&#146;t know, I
mean maybe it&#146;s just being here at the beach together or, I don&#146;t know. But
it&#146;s like something... (she&#146;s interrupted by the sound of Bonnie entering)</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> What are you guys doing?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We&#146;re playing Strip Happy Days Game!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Cool! I&#146;ll catch up! (She takes off her sweater.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The beach house, the next morning. Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen
eating breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, you still don&#146;t think I&#146;m boyfriend material?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I saw you checking me out during the game last night.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You didn&#146;t even take off your pants.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, lucky for you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the <b>best</b> time?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Shhh! Shhhh! Joey&#146;s asleep.</p>

<p>(Joey is sleeping on the floor and is buried in sand that has been carved into a
mermaid complete with breasts.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn&#146;t up yet. Did you guys hear
them last night?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah, I don&#146;t know what they were doing, but at one point sea
turtles actually came up to the house.</p>

<p>(Ross and Bonnie enter)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Good morning.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hey! How did everybody sleep?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, great.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Like a log.</p>

<p><b>Ross and Bonnie:</b> Us too.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m going for a walk.</p>

<p>(Joey finally wakes up.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Joey) Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.</p>

<p>(Joey looks down and his look turns from shock to satisfaction.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The porch, Bonnie is coming back from swimming, Rachel is reading.]</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hey, what happened to you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, ah nothin&#146;. I just felt like hangin&#146; out here and reading.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came
off.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh-ha-ha!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much
easier when I used to shave my head.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just <b>loved</b> your look when you were
bald.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean you definitely should do that.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Y'know what, I should do it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> All right.</p>

<p>(As Bonnie goes to do just that, Rachel smiles to herself, proud of what she&#146;s
done.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The beach house, at night. Phoebe is hangs up the phone, and gently pushes one
of the stools over.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What&#146;s the matter, Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She&#146;s avoiding
me, she doesn&#146;t want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won&#146;t
tell me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aww Pheebs, that sucks!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, well, don&#146;t &#147;Aww Pheebs, that sucks!&#148; me yet. (she
starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where ya going?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, she&#146;s out of town so, there&#146;s gotta be something in her
house that tells me where my Father is.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, are any of those people here?!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh, no!! No, no!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I&#146;ll-I&#146;ll fill her
ice trays.</p>

<p>(She exits just as Bonnie comes down the stairs, as bald as Michael Jordan.)</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hey, everybody!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Wow!! (they all recoil in shock and horror)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wh-haa-haa! Look what &#145;cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her mouth
to keep from laughing.)</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You wanna touch it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nooo, but it, but it&#146;s great.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Come on, touch it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in your skull.</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside the beach house, Ross is coming out to talk to Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she
happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who
was it? Oh, that&#146;s right, that&#146;s right, it was you!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That was her idea, <b>I</b> just gave her a nudge.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She said you gave her the razor!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> (joining them) Hey guys.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ahh, no, I&#146;m good.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Okay, I&#146;ll see you in a bit.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, have fun! Wooo!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on see, she doesn&#146;t look that bad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you
thinking?!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You don&#146;t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right! Ross, do you think it&#146;s easy for me to see you with
somebody else?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know, hey! You&#146;re the one who ended it, remember?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, because I was <b>mad</b> at you, not because I stopped loving you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You still love me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You still love me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get
back together?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo! Maybe! I, I don&#146;t know. Ross, I still can&#146;t forgive you
for what you did, I can&#146;t, I just, but sometimes when I&#146;m with you I just, I
feel so...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I just, I feel, I-I just...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I feel...</p>

<p>(Ross leans in and kisses her. They both look at each other for a moment, and then
embrace in a more passionate kiss, only to be interrupted by Joey and Chandler coming
outside.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) Noo!! I don&#146;t care! I&#146;m not, I&#146;m not gonna
playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice! </p>

<p>(Rachel and Ross both stop kissing, and quickly step back from each other.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But I made cards!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well! Good night. (to Ross) I&#146;m going upstairs.</p>

<p><b>Joey and Chandler:</b> G&#146;night.</p>

<p>(Rachel walks inside, stops, and turns back to look at Ross for a moment then goes
upstairs.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Ross) Wanna play strip poker for practice?</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe Sr.&#146;s house, Phoebe is breaking in through a window.]</p>

<p>(She throws her bag inside, and starts to climb through the window. She gets halfway in
and the window slams shut on her butt.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely inside and the
window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!</p>

<p>(She starts walking across the darkened room and hits her head on a wind chime hanging
from the ceiling, to stop it from making a noise she grabs it and &#147;Shhh&#146;s&#148;
it. She goes into the kitchen and finds Phoebe Sr.&#146;s appointment book, to read it she
opens the freezer. Just as she starts to read, Phoebe Sr. jumps out from her bedroom with
a coat hanger, startling Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! No!! It&#146;s me! It&#146;s me! I-I didn&#146;t want to make any
noise!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Then don't break in!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> What are you doing here?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay,
because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing
right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if
you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you&#146;re just mean! (pause)
So, just tell me the truth!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> My Father is Chuck Magioni?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> No, no, that&#146;s just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last
year! And I&#146;m very sorry, but I don&#146;t know where your Father is, and that&#146;s
the truth.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> But umm, you&#146;re right. I think that a person should know where
they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, (pause) ahh, (pause) okay. I&#146;m your mother.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Heh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all
floopy, and... </p>

<p>(At that Phoebe&#146;s eyes open in shock.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside the beach house, Ross is telling Joey and Chandler what happened with
Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s not true! Her, she doesn&#146;t even know what she wants!
Rachel&#146;s still mad about the whole thing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don&#146;t need that
kind&#146;ve hurt. Take it from a guy who&#146;s never had a long term relationship......</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> (coming back from her swim) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You guys, the water&#146;s great. You should really go in.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&amp;M.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Okay, well g&#146;night.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Good night.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> (kisses Ross) Don&#146;t be too long.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okey-dokey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There is not <b>one</b> hair on that head.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, it&#146;ll grow back, right? And she-she&#146;s really fun, and
she&#146;s cool, and-and I&#146;m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel
was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know, and I&#146;m finally feeling
sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her,
and-and-and it doesn&#146;t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that
again?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you&#146;re
doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie&#146;s free tonight?</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the bedrooms. Ross is coming upstairs and stops between two
doors. He looks at the one on the right, then he looks at the one on his left, thinks
about it, and goes in the one on his right.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Closing Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: The beach house, Chandler is simulating he&#146;s coming to pick up Monica for
a date. Chandler knocks on the door, and Monica answers it.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (in a fake voice) Hi there.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s that weird voice again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you&#146;re gonna wanna date this
next guy, I swear!</p>

<p>(Monica closes the door, Chandler knocks, and Monica opens it to reveal Chandler on his
knees.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi! I&#146;m Dorf! You&#146;re date for the evening. (Monica walks
away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that&#146;s good stuff!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode)
Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom
and dad, and I don&#146;t really know what happened with that.</p>

<p>[cut to Phoebe Sr.&#146;s house, from the last episode]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> (to Phoebe) I&#146;m your mother.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ehh?</p>

<p>[cut to Monica opening the door of the beach house, with Chandler trying to pick her up
for a date.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn&#146;t go out with
a guy like Chandler...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away
in disgust)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (voice-over) ...and he couldn&#146;t let it go, and... I don&#146;t really
know what happened with that either. </p>

<p>[cut to a montage of scenes involving Bonnie, Ross, and Rachel from the last episode.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross&#146;s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up
and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has
to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don&#146;t know what happened there
either... </p>

<p>[cut back to Joey on the beach towel]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The beach house, it&#146;s the same scene from the end of last year, with Ross
in front of the two doors of Rachel&#146;s and Bonnie&#146;s rooms, trying to decide which
door to choose. He finally chooses the one his right and goes in.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (surprised) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel and Bonnie:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Awww.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> (to Rachel) Thanks a million.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you&#146;re welcome a million.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> (getting up and leaving) (to Ross) Okay, I&#146;ll see you in our room.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (softly) Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know.</p>

<p>(They both kiss again and fall onto the bed.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa! What?! Why?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Here?! Now?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, yeah. I can&#146;t-I can&#146;t stay here all night, and if I go in
there she&#146;s-she&#146;s gonna wanna... do stuff.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, can&#146;t you tell her that you are not in the mood?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn&#146;t work either, I
can&#146;t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting) Whoa-ho.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p>(they kiss again)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn&#146;t every morning.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, making it worse!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe Sr.&#146;s house, it&#146;s right after she told Phoebe that she&#146;s
her birth mother.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> So I guess you&#146;d like to know how it all happened. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,
and everyone started lying their asses off!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Noo! No! It wasn&#146;t like that I... Remember how I told you how
Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How close?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&#146;t even know how that would work!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Well, we were...</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (interrupting) I&#146;m not asking!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was
stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it&#146;s like to
be eighteen years old?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Let&#146;s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,
and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Well, I&#146;m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best
parents in the world, I didn&#146;t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years
ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don&#146;t know, you&#146;re here, and I
would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, well, everybody does! I&#146;m a really cool person. And y'know
you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn&#146;t even try! Y'know what, you walked
out on me, and I&#146;m just, I&#146;m gonna do the same thing to you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Wait!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&#146;t <b>ever</b> want to see you again! </p>

<p>(She walks out and slams the door.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where&#146;s my
purse?</p>

<p>[Scene: The beach house, Joey and Chandler are sitting at the dinner table, Monica is
looking in the fridge.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We&#146;re out of soda.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (jumping up) Oh, I&#146;ll go out and get you some.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nope! Because I&#146;m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who&#146;s
entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, umm, my Mom&#146;s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.</p>

<p>(The gang is shocked.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I found a dried up seashores.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sweety, what are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, my new Mom, who-who&#146;s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go
upstairs)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don&#146;t you wanna stay here and talk
about it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. I&#146;m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.</p>

<p>(She starts to go upstairs.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (turning around, insistently) Monica!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh.</p>

<p>[Scene: The beach house, Rachel&#146;s bedroom. She is finishing up writing something
as Ross walks through the door.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s over.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, was it awful?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, it was loong. I didn&#146;t even realise how late it was, until I
noticed the 5 o&#146;clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop
themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn&#146;t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.</p>

<p>(They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I wrote you a letter.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns
away.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (handing him the letter) It&#146;s just some things I&#146;ve been
thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us
getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him
from making contact.) Wow, it&#146;s-it&#146;s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So,
I&#146;d better get cracking on this baby.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I&#146;ll be waiting for you, just come up when you&#146;re done.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I&#146;ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back.
Very exciting.</p>

<p>[Scene: The beach house, the next morning. Ross is passed out on the kitchen counter.
He wakes up with a start and has one of the pages of the letter stuck to his face.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes
reading the letter)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the
letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why
didn&#146;t you come up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Done!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You just finished?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very
important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So umm, does it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Does it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole &#145;Does it?&#146;
part just another glance.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn&#146;t, and if you have to even <b>think</b>
about it...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t <b>have</b>
to think about it, in fact, I&#146;ve decided, I&#146;ve decided that, that it.......does.</p>

<p>(Rachel stands there for a moment, starting to cry. Then gasps and runs over and hugs
him. While hugging her, Ross tries to find the &#145;Does it?&#146; part in the letter.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, sure! I&#146;m sure.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from
the letter.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The beach. Chandler and Monica are out getting some sun.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, there&#146;s a nuclear holocaust, I&#146;m the last man on
Earth. Would you go out with me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ennnh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;ve got canned goods.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you
guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check
this baby out, dug me a hole!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excellent hole, Joe.</p>

<p>(A wave crashes on the beach and partially fills up his hole.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no! No!! My hole!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s like two miles!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, and I&#146;m a little tired from digging the hole.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We&#146;ve got to do something!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, there&#146;s really only one thing you can do.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! What is it?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You&#146;re gonna have to pee on it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!! Gross!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don&#146;t blame me, I saw it on <i>The Discovery Channel</i>.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what, he&#146;s right. There&#146;s something like uh, ammonia
in that, that like kills the pain.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well forget it! It doesn&#146;t hurt that (tries to take a step) <b>baaad</b>!!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> If you want some privacy you can use my hole.</p>

<p>[Scene: The beach house, Phoebe is coming down the stairs all packed and ready to go.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I&#146;m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel
cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod &#145;Yes.&#146;) Ohh!
That&#146;s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod &#145;No.&#146;) But for you, yay!
Ohh.</p>

<p>(The rest of the gang arrives with their heads down in shame.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How was the beach?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing, I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing. I&#146;m gonna take a shower.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Me too!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Me too.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I&#146;m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It does. It really and truly does.</p>

<p>(Rachel kisses him, and goes upstairs. After she&#146;s gone, Ross frantically tries to
find and read the &#145;Does it?&#146; part.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does <b>not</b>!!!</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is telling Joey and Chandler about the letter.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She wants <b>me</b> to take responsibility for everything that went wrong
in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful
to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say &#148;Well...&#148;)
(yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God! If you say that one more time, <b>I&#146;m</b> gonna break
up with you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says
here, (reading from the letter) &#147;If you accept full responsibility...&#148; (to
Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! &#147;...I can begin to trust you again. Does that
seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!&#148;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, Ross, you have what you want, you&#146;re back with Rachel. If
you bring this up now you&#146;re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you&#146;re right. Yeah I guess
I&#146;ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure, it&#146;s hard to forget! But that doesn&#146;t mean you have to
talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler)
ever talk about.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What the hell happened on that beach?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s between us and the sea, Ross!</p>

<p>(Ross laughs and has a &#145;Come on...&#146; look on his face as he looks and Chandler
who nods his head in agreement with Joey. Ross is stunned.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A hallway in an apartment building. Phoebe is knocks on a door and it opens.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.</p>

<p><b>Ursula:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, well umm, I know that we haven&#146;t talked in a long time, but
umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.</p>

<p><b>Ursula:</b> Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (shocked) You know her?!</p>

<p><b>Ursula:</b> No, I umm, I read about her in Mom&#146;s suicide note.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods &#145;Yes.&#146;) Well, do
you still have it?</p>

<p><b>Ursula:</b> (disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door in
Phoebe&#146;s face.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&#146;t believe you didn&#146;t tell me there was a suicide note!</p>

<p><b>Ursula:</b> Yeah. So how have you been doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I, umm, shut up!</p>

<p>(Ursula opens the door and hands her the note.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (reading from the note) &#147;Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I&#146;ll miss
you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.&#148; You just wrote this!</p>

<p><b>Ursula:</b> Well, it&#146;s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You
read the poem, right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Noooo!!</p>

<p><b>Ursula:</b> All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartment
and slams the door shut.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are sitting at the table eating
dinner and not talking. Ross and Rachel are outside cuddling on the balcony.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Pass the cheese, please.</p>

<p>(Joey hands her the cheese without looking at her.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> My God, you can&#146;t even look at me! Can you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nope.</p>

<p>(Phoebe enters.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. I&#146;m-I&#146;m to depressed to talk.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think
about making that beach trip an annual thing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler, Monica, and Joey:</b> NO!!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, that&#146;s it, you guys! What happened out there?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over
me.</p>

<p><b>Ross and Rachel:</b> Come on!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What happened? Joey?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. (gets up) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we&#146;d never tell!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (running over and joining Monica) They&#146;ll never understand!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It&#146;s eating me
alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living
room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn&#146;t stand. I-I couldn&#146;t walk.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.
We didn&#146;t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica&#146;s
shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I was in too much pain.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And I was tired from digging the huge hole!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And then Joey remembered something.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;d seen this thing on <i>The Discovery Channel</i>...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait a minute! I saw that! On <i>The Discovery Channel</i>, yeah! About
jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed
on yourself?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe and Rachel:</b> Ewwww!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You can&#146;t say that!! You-you don&#146;t know!! I mean I thought I
was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn&#146;t...bend that way.
So... (looks at Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel:</b> (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s right I stepped up! She&#146;s my friend and she needed help!
And if I had too, I&#146;d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn&#146;t. I got the
stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to
Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, &#147;Do it
now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!&#148; Sometimes late at night I can still here the
screaming.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (laughs) That&#146;s &#145;cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to
freak you out.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is finishing up a song.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) &#147;...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my
bedroommmm.&#148; (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the
colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you.
You go away.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> I&#146;ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there
hasn&#146;t been a day where I didn&#146;t regret giving you up.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, bye.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> No, I&#146;m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the
reason I didn&#146;t look you up was, well I was afraid that you&#146;d react, just well
like, the way, the way you&#146;re reacting right now, and can&#146;t we just, y'know,
start from here?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family.
I&#146;m family, I&#146;m it. Now, now I&#146;m done. (starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But, it&#146;s not like we&#146;re losing anything. Y'know?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Yeah, I guess you&#146;re right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&#146;s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have <b>anything</b>
in common.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Well, I don&#146;t know. I mean it&#146;s not like we don&#146;t
have <b>anything</b> in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I like pizza!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, so do I!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> I knew it, wow!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Ohh, so cute.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I&#146;m-I&#146;m mad at you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> I know. I&#146;m mad at me too.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I&#146;m kinda hungry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr.:</b> Hey! Me too!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, stop it. Now you&#146;re just doing it to freak me out.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s bedroom. Ross and Rachel have just finished consummating the new
relationship.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-hooo, I missed you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I missed you too.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to
everything, it just showed me how much you&#146;ve grown. Y'know?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (getting miffed) I suppose.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom <b>never</b>
thought this would work out. It was all, &#147;Once a cheater, always a cheater.&#148;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (getting angry) Umm-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, I just wish we hadn&#146;t lost those four months, but if time was
what you needed just to gain a little perspective...</p>

<p>[cut to Monica cleaning the floor in the kitchen]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You bet.</p>

<p>[cut back to Rachel&#146;s bedroom with both of them hurriedly getting dressed]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And for the record, it took <b>two</b> people to break up this
relationship!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I didn&#146;t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I
didn&#146;t finish the whole letter!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I fell asleep!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You fell asleep?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and
back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen)
(to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means &#145;you are,&#146;
Y-O-U-R means &#145;your!&#146;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know I can&#146;t believe I even <b>thought</b> about getting back
together again! We are so over!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy
when you&#146;re at home on Saturday nights playing <i>Scrabble</i> with Monica!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep
you&#146;re gonna miss wishing you were with me!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, no-no-no don&#146;t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have
your letter!!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And hey! Just so you know, it&#146;s <b>not</b> that common! It <b>doesn&#146;t</b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this
game naked.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Will you stop!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. All right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, all right, I think you&#146;re great, I think you&#146;re sweet,

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn
and slide.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You don&#146;t turn and slide, you throw it out! I&#146;m tired of

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, we&#146;re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, how about we, how &#145;bout we sell it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. But, you&#146;re gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet
to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as
decorations.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to
Joey) They seem all right with it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no-no, <b>she</b> was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom
Lily, the one who killed herself.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you sure she&#146;s in the cat, or have you been taking your
grandma&#146;s glycoma medicine again?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No Dr. Skeptismo! I&#146;m sure. First of all, okay, there&#146;s the
feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my
guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My
Mother&#146;s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then
nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to
the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an &#147;Oh my God.&#148; gesture) Oh, I

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, you and I went to different high schools...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, that doesn&#146;t help me, because we went to the same high
school.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off
Chip&#146;s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band
uniform they had to have specially made.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out
with a Chip Matthews, and now he&#146;s-he&#146;s called me up and asked me out. And the
fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, really?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Just, if it&#146;s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go
have sex with another guy?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;ll try.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, they are all there eating breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don&#146;t think
any of them are gonna work out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not
everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,
trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I&#146;m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to
the fact that there&#146;s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she&#146;s worried that
y'know, she&#146;s gonna, she&#146;s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)
Well, that&#146;s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in
the other room.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why can&#146;t you use the phone in here?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I&#146;m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I
just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica&#146;s room)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe&#146;s mom remind anyone of a <b>cat</b>?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, don&#146;t start.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, you-you can&#146;t tell me you actually believe that-that
there&#146;s a woman inside that cat!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I believe it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No you don&#146;t. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, I do.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No you do&#151;y'know what, you&#146;re not gonna suck me into this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I do not always have to be&#151;okay, okay. (starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>Jurassic Park</i> could happen.</p>

<p>(Ross wants to say something, but just smiles and leaves.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are showing a couple of guys (Tony and
Peter) the entertainment center.]</p>

<p><b>Tony:</b> Wow! That&#146;s ah, that&#146;s pretty nice!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pretty nice?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&#146;ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.</p>

<p><b>Tony:</b> We don&#146;t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it?
We&#146;ve got a canoe.</p>

<p>(Joey jumps up in excitement and without turning around Chandler holds out his hand
stopping him, and ushering him back into his seat. Joey sits down, dejected.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I, I really don&#146;t think we need a canoe.</p>

<p><b>Tony:</b> You gotta take the canoe!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you
get home, throw the canoe away!</p>

<p><b>Peter:</b> We&#146;re not throwing it away! I built that canoe! (starts to leave as
Tony chases after him)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Peter) Good for you!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Ross are there.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) You guys, you&#146;re never gonna believe what I just found
tacked up on a telephone pole! (She&#146;s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe&#146;s mother also goes by the name
Julio.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You guys, there&#146;s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I
mean, you know what that means?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do we have to tell her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, we have to tell her!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, but it&#146;s made her so happy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand)
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have
dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> (disappointed) Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I <b>hate</b> when Ross is right!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He is right, isn&#146;t he?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he&#146;s wrong.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> You think?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-no, he&#146;s right.</font></p>

compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I
couldn&#146;t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It
was funny &#145;til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> No, you, you can&#146;t fit in that thing. That&#146;s not deep enough.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can&#146;t,
I&#146;ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> All right, you have yourself a deal. (shakes his hand)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya! </p>

<p>(The guys takes a hockey stick and slips it through the handles then proceeds to take
the stereo and Chandler&#146;s computer and walk out.)</p>

<p><b>Chip:</b> No, I think it&#146;s cute. (kisses her)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! A lipper from Chipper.</p>

J.T., Breadsly.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is that all?</p>

<p><b>Chip:</b> Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran

got to dump Chip Matthews.</p>

calling us.&#148;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn&#146;t tell her?! (They all kinda
shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all
over the place.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to
respect her decision. Right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel:</b> That&#146;s a good call. Right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! Look&#151;Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel
guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom.
This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross,
how many parents have you lost?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> None.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, then you don&#146;t know what it feels like when one of them comes
back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I&#146;m wrong, who cares? Just be a
friend. Okay? Be supportive.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t know what to say.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You could.... say you&#146;re sorry to her mom.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think she would like that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs.
Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you
were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend&#146;s
mother.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you. We both forgive you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to
me. And you&#146;re welcome to come back anytime.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we&#146;d really appreciate
it. (Joey nods in agreement)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, Mom, I&#146;ll take you home.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;ll go with you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Me too. (they all leave)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting in the canoe as Joey runs through the
door carrying an outdoor patio table.]</p>

<p><strong>Joey: </strong>Hey!! We are <strong>so</strong> in luck! Treeger said that we
could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the
hall)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Oh no-no-no, I&#146;m, I&#146;m paddling away!</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> (Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Uh-huh. This <strong>and</strong> a bunch of bubble wrap. And,
some of it is not even popped! </p>

<p>(They both sit down at the table and the chick and the duck enter from Joey&#146;s
bedroom.)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Could we <strong>be</strong> more white trash?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong>: (Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Oh! Good thing Chandler&#146;s not here, he always wins at
this game.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong>: I just told my Mom I&#146;d cater a party for her.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: How come?</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Because I need the money, and I thought that it&#146;d be a
great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.</p>

<p><strong>Ross: </strong>Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don&#146;t think Mom
would&#146;ve hired you if she didn&#146;t think you were good at what you do.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong>: You don&#146;t have to stick up for her. She can&#146;t here
you.</p>

for work.]</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Just pickle.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the
street yesterday.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must&#146;ve been awkward.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a
drink.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: (laughs) You ah, you didn&#146;t say &#145;Yes&#146; to that
did you?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>(laughs) No. No!</p>

<p><strong>Joanna</strong>: (Coming out of the shower wearing nothing but a towel) Hello,
Rachel. (She goes into Chandler&#146;s bedroom)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, not at first.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> What is she doing here?</p>

<p>(Joey makes a sound like a creaking bed.)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I don&#146;t understand! Last time you went out with her you
said she was a &#145;big, dull dud.&#146;</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we
were able to take the relationship to the next level.</p>

<p>(Joey creaks louder)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must
end it now!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>Oh, come on! It&#146;s not like this is an everyday
occurrence for me! I mean usually I&#146;m pretty much just in there by myself.</p>

<p>(Joey makes a sound imitating one person making a bed creak and Chandler turns and
glares at him.)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end
it.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Okay, I promise, I&#146;ll end it.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Doing great, the quiches are coming along.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> What&#146;s this? Blue nail polish?</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Yeah, I thought it was cute.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Ahh, that&#146;s what your Grandmother&#146;s hands
looked like when we found her.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Let me ask you a question.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller</strong>: Hmm.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Why did you hire me?</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of
course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very
nice, I assume you weren&#146;t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would
be something. (Leaves)</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because
she thinks I&#146;m good.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe: </strong>Okay, I didn&#146;t hear that.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh yeah, she didn&#146;t hire me out of pity, it wasn&#146;t
so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I&#146;m good.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Wow! And hey, it&#146;s cool if you&#146;re a lesbian! (Gives
her a thumbs up)</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> (Entering before Joey can say anything) Good afternoon,
are you the decision maker of the house?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Uhhhh. (He&#146;s not sure)</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? </p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in
there.</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> Actually, I&#146;m not buying. I&#146;m selling. Let me
ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even
though you&#146;re not really sure what they&#146;re talking about?</p>

<p>(We go into a flashback sequence with Joey remembering some of those times.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica and Rachel&#146;s apartment, all are there.]</p>

<p><strong>Ross</strong>: &#133;I&#146;m telling you it&#146;s totally unconstituional.</p>

<p><strong>Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Rachel:</strong> Oh yeah, I totally agree.</p>

<p>(Joey just nods his head.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Central Perk, the entire gang is there.]</p>

&#145;Yes.&#146;)</p>

<p><strong>All: </strong>Nooo!! (Joey quickly stops nodding his head.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica and Rachel&#146;s, they&#146;re all there playing cards.]</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> &#133;it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh,
but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)</p>

<p>[Cut back to the present day.]</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman: </strong>(Interrupting the flashback) Excuse me, I&#146;m sorry,
you haven&#146;t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all
interested?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Geller&#146;s Kitchen, Monica and Phoebe are still cooking.]</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe: </strong>That&#146;s weird.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>What?</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Your nails.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom
wouldn&#146;t give me grief about me biting them.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, no, I meant that it&#146;s weird that you only have nine
now.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them
put&#133; (realises) Oh my God! It&#146;s in the quiche! Oh My God!</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Okay, don&#146;t panic. I&#146;m gonna go to the store,
I&#146;m gonna get you another set of nails, no one&#146;s gonna know, and you&#146;re
gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it&#146;s &#145;cause
they&#146;re gonna eat&#151;that&#146;s the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> (entering) (to Monica) Honey, don&#146;t bite your nails.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Okay ah, please don&#146;t freak out. Umm, but ah,
there&#146;s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there&#146;s no way to know
which one.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe: </strong>And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> (laughs) I&#146;m not freaking out.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Then why are you laughing?</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> It&#146;s nothing, it&#146;s just that now your Father
owes me five dollars.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>What? You bet I&#146;d lose a nail?</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller: </strong>Oh no, don&#146;t be silly. I just bet I&#146;d need
these. (Opens the freezer to reveal&#133;)</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Frozen lasagnas?</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Um-hmm.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> You bet that I&#146;d screw up?! So all that stuff about
hiring me because I was good was&#133;</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller</strong>: No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you
pulled a Monica.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong>: You promised Dr. Weinburg, you&#146;d never use that phrase.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller: </strong>Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you&#146;ve
never been able to laugh at yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>(laughs) That&#146;s right. My Mom doesn&#146;t have any faith
in me! Oh, that&#146;s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> I don&#146;t get it.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> No, I have faith&#133;</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>(interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an
awkward silence follows.)</p>

<p><strong>Oven:</strong> Ding!</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Op, the ruined quiches are ready.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joanna&#146;s office, Joanna and Chandler are making out on her chair. Chandler
isn&#146;t wearing any pants.]</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> It just doesn&#146;t&#133;feel like we&#146;re breaking up.</p>

<p><strong>Joanna: </strong>No, we are. I&#146;m sad.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p>(They start kissing again, but are interrupted by the phone.</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> (answering the phone) Yes. (listens) Uh, can&#146;t you wait
until tomorrow? (listens) All right. (hangs up) Unbelievable!!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)</p>

<p><strong>Joanna: </strong>What are you doing?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: I&#146;m getting dressed.</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Why?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.</p>

<p><strong>Joanna</strong>: Wait. I wanna show you something.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler</strong>: What is it?</p>

<p><strong>Joanna</strong>: Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. (She&#146;s holding a
pair of handcuffs) Put your hands together.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Ah-ha, you&#146;re not the boss of me. (She kisses him)
Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.</p>

<p><strong>Joanna: </strong>(kisses him) I&#146;ll be back in ten minutes. (Starts to
leave)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You are, you&#146;re gonna leave me like this?</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> Knowing you&#146;re here, waiting for me I think it&#146;s
kinda exciting.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Okay. But if you don&#146;t come back soon, (She leaves and
closes the door) there&#146;s pretty much nothing I can do about it!</p>

<p>[Cut to Joanna&#146;s outer office, where Rachel and Sophie work. They are both coming
back from lunch.]</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> (locking her door) Oh.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie: </strong>Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!</p>

<p><strong>Joanna: </strong>Oh great! I&#146;ll keep it in my butt with your nose. (She
grabs the cookie and walks out.)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>That&#146;s weird, she locked the door.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie:</strong> Y&#146;know why? She&#146;s got the Christmas bonus list in
there. I saw her working on it this morning.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Okay, swear you won&#146;t tell, but when Mark left he gave me
a key to Joanna&#146;s office. Do you wanna see the list?</p>

<p><strong>Sophie:</strong> Yeah!</p>

<p>(Rachel unlocks and opens the door to reveal a half-naked Chandler handcuffed to the
chair. They both gasp and Chandler stares at them in shock and surprise.)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?</p>

<p>(Rachel and Sophie both back out and close the door without saying anything.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Joanna&#146;s office, Chandler, still handcuffed to the chair, is looking
through the lingerie catalogue by turning the pages with his teeth. The phone rings and
Chandler answers it with his nose.]</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>Hello, Joanna&#133;(Realises he doesn&#146;t know her last
name)&#133;&#146;s office.</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> (on speaker phone) I&#146;m really sorry but I may be a little
while longer.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> How little?!</p>

<p><strong>Joanna: </strong>A couple of hours, I feel awful.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Look, this isn&#146;t funny! You get back here right now!</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> I can&#146;t!!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>Why not?!</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> I&#146;m in my boss&#146;s car!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> What?!</p>

<p><strong>Joanna: </strong>Uh-oh, tunnel. (The phone gets cut off)</p>

<p>(Chandler gets an idea)</p>

<p>[Cut to Rachel&#146;s office as her intercom buzzes.]</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (answering it) (angrily) What?!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you
for a moment?</p>

<p>(Rachel goes into talk to Chandler.)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Okay, here&#146;s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are
on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock
me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>You <strong>promised</strong> you would break up with her!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>I did break up with her! She just took it really, really
well!</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never
entered your mind?!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made
it, shoot right out.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you
get yourself out of them.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can&#146;t get myself right out of
them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock
me, she could be gone for hours, and I&#146;m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a
statue behind Joanna&#146;s desk.)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You
never see Joanna again!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Never!</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> You never come into this office again!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Fine!</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>You give me back my Walkman!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I&#151;never borrowed your Walkman.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes
over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Does it hurt?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>No, I just always see guys doing this when they get
handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>About what?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> When she sees that you&#146;re gone, she&#146;s gonna know
that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I&#146;m gonna get fired!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>I&#146;ll make something up! I&#146;m good at lying, I
actually did borrow your Walkman!</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>No, there&#146;s nothing to make up, she&#146;s gonna know
that I have a key to her office, I&#146;ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!
(She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Oh-ho-ho, I don&#146;t think so!</p>

<p>(He starts to put his pants on, but Rachel manages to drag him to the chair. When they
get to the chair, Chandler drops his pants and knocks the chair away. Rachel then backs
him up and locks him to the top drawer of a filing cabinet.)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Well, this is much better.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, The salesman is trying to sell Joey the encyclopedias.]</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> So, here&#146;s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you
know about Van Gogh?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> He cut off his ear.</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman: </strong>And?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I&#146;m out.</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> He painted that. (Points to one of his paintings in the
book)</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Wow! That&#146;s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear
&#145;cause he sucked. What else you got in there?</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> Let&#146;s see, ahhh&#133; Where does the Pope live?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> In the woods. No wait-wait, that&#146;s the joke answer.</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know
about vulcanised rubber?</p>

<p><strong>Joey: </strong>Spock&#146;s birth control.</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> (laughs) You <strong>need</strong> these books.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica&#146;s childhood bedroom (which has been turned into a gym), Monica is
lying on the treadmill as Phoebe enters.]</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Hey!</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Hi.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> This used to be your room? (She nods &#145;Yes&#146;) Wow! You
must&#146;ve been in really good shape as a kid.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Ohh, I&#146;m such an idiot. I can&#146;t believe I actually
thought she could change.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Oh good, I&#146;m glad that&#146;s catching on.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what
it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired
to do, and we&#146;ll call that pulling a Monica.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>What?</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe: </strong>Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A&#146;s, his parents would
say, &quot;Yeah, he pulled a Monica.&quot; Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,
&quot;Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica.&quot; Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer
says, &quot;Yeah, that one&#146;s outta here.&quot; Though some things don&#146;t change.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>(getting up) All right, I&#146;ll go down there. But, I&#146;m
not gonna serve the lasagna. I&#146;m gonna serve something I make.</p>

<p>(She exits and Phoebe goes over and sits down at the machine that works your shoulders
and tries to do one, which she does, easily.)</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins
Monica.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Joanna&#146;s office, Rachel and Chandler are having a little tug-of-war with
his pants.]</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back
the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she&#146;s very private about her office.
Now I know why.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Hey, look, you&#146;re in trouble either way! Okay? If she
comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she&#146;s gonna know you were
in here. So you might as well just let me go.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>What if I clean your bathroom for a month?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> It still wouldn&#146;t be clean. (Rachel makes an &#145;Eww,
disgusting!&#146; face) All I want is my freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Foot rubs for a month!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>Freedom!</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>I&#146;ll take all of your photos and put them into photo
albums!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won&#146;t you here me?!
(Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Sophie sit!!</p>

<p>(She closes the door and puts his tie into his mouth as a gag.)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> No! God, would you just calm down!</p>

<p>(Chandler screams a little bit, then realises that he can spit out his gag. He does so
with a &#145;Pouff!&#146;)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>I&#146;m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please
just&#133; (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head,
which proves his point.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is now reading the &#145;V&#146; book, with the
salesman watching.]</p>

<p><strong>Joey: </strong>Wow! There&#146;s a lot I didn&#146;t know about vomit. (The
duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck
goes back into the bathroom.)</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of
encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I&#146;m home in
the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there&#146;s a
few things you don&#146;t get from book learnin&#146;.</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> Well ah, what can you swing?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman: </strong>You don&#146;t have, anything?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets)
Okay? I&#146;ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an
army man. Hey!</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman: </strong>Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
(Starts to leave)</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be
Chandler&#146;s pants.</p>

<p><strong>The Salesman:</strong> For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A?
B? C?</p>

<p><strong>Joey: </strong>Oh, I-I think I&#146;m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how
this bad boy turns out.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joanna&#146;s office, Rachel and Chandler are still negotiating.]</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> No!</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I ah&#133; Oh! I&#146;ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every
morning!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>With extra pulp?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (happily) Yeah!!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> No!</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> D&#146;oh!! (pause) I&#146;ve got it!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>You don&#146;t have it.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> I have <strong>so</strong> got it. There&#146;s gonna be
rumours about this, there&#146;s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> How do Monica and Phoebe know?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be
very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>(intrigued) Go on.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation&#146;s
Milton Berle.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> And Milton Berle has a&#133;</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Geller&#146;s kitchen, Phoebe is bringing in some dirty dishes.]</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Well?</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe: </strong>They&#146;re not even touching the lasagna!</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Really?!</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh, they love your casserole.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Yes!!</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe: </strong>It&#146;s hard to believe that just a little while ago this
was nothing but ingredients.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> (entering) Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> And you?</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> I thought it was&#133; quite tasty.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make
this a success. Which would make you&#133;</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller: </strong>(interrupting) A bitch?</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller: </strong>Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really
impressed me today.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Wow!</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both
look at her) (to Monica) She doesn&#146;t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head
&#145;No.&#146;)</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing
but ice in the freezer. (She starts to bite her nails)</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don&#146;t bite your
nails.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, all except Chandler, are there.]</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>(hello) Hello.</p>

<p><strong>Joey, Rachel, and Ross: </strong>Hey!</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on
her face.)</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Wh-what&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh. </p>

<p>(She motions for them to come closer, they lean in and she whispers what Rachel told
her. The guys both lean back laughing.]</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> No he doesn&#146;t!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>(checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> So did you break up with Joanna?</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> I think so.</p>

<p><strong>Joey: </strong>Well, it&#146;s good thing you got out when you did, before she
blew up like that Vesuvius.</p>

<p><strong>Ross: </strong>The volcano?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous
rock formation.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>What?!</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.</p>

<p><strong>Monica: </strong>Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk
about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
(Joey is pissed)</p>

<p><strong>All: </strong>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> With such a sad history.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> Could there <strong>be</strong> more Kims?</p>

<p>(They all laugh and Joey joins them, not to be left out. When the laughing dies down,
he has a depressed look on his face.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, Rachel is coming in for the day.]</p>

<p><strong>Joanna: </strong>(from her office) Who&#146;s out there?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> It&#146;s me! Good morning!</p>

<p><strong>Joanna: </strong>Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn&#146;t have poppy seed bagels, so
I&#133; (Enters Joanna&#146;s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing
but a slip) Oh my word!</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please
get the key off the back of the door for me.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> Oh, yeah! Yeah!</p>

<p>(She goes back and forth, not sure what to do first, put the bagel down or grab the
key. She finally puts the bagel down and grabs the key and goes over to unlock Joanna.)</p>

<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> You tell your friend Chandler that we&#146;re <strong>definately</strong>
broken up this time.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is there eating breakfast. Chandler is cleaning
out his wallet.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! New wallet, huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just
doesn&#146;t say &#145;cool&#146; anymore.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I thought you <b>liked</b> doing it. (Rachel starts out the door
and stops.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Third door on the left.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right!</p>

<p>[Scene: Garbage room: Mr. Treeger is unclogging the trash chute as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b>: Hey.</p>

<p>(Rachel opens the trash chute, winces at the smell, and throws the garbage bag in. She
then tries to throw the pizza box in, but since it&#146;s so big she jams it into the
opening and it prevents the door from closing. She then turns around too see Mr. Treeger
watching her.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b>: What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ummm. Oh! I&#146;m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)
It&#146;s a little old but&#133;</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b>: No! You&#146;re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, please don&#146;t do that. I think it&#146;s best that we just
forget about it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s easy for you to say, you weren&#146;t almost just killed.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right that&#146;s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the

missed the last 1200 times.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So why don&#146;t you quit?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You don&#146;t think I&#146;ve tried? You think I <b>like</b> having
50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down
there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they
bring out Maria.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who is Maria?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh Maria. You can&#146;t say no to her, she&#146;s like this lycra
spandex covered gym&#133;treat.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,
you&#146;re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the
landlord.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b>: And tell him what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b>: Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act
of 1968!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I have actually <b>not</b> heard of that.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b>: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I&#146;ve been a
nice guy up until now, but uh, I don&#146;t need this grief. I&#146;m gonna call the
landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother&#146;s
apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why don&#146;t you tell me something I don&#146;t know! (He storms out,

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every
time I see him I just want to do things to him that I&#146;m not allowed to charge for.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So do them for free.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling
around with clients. And it&#146;s against my oath as a masseuse.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> They make you take an oath?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and
umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one&#146;s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just
makes good sense.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why don&#146;t you just give him to somebody else?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I can handle it. No, I&#146;m a professional. (She starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like
that and that he&#146;d better come up here and apologize. I&#146;ll see you later.
(Starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What a minute, what did he say?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He said that he wasn&#146;t gonna apologize because you guys are living
here illegally, so instead what he&#146;s gonna do is have you evicted&#151;I&#146;ll see
you later.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! You got us evicted!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I told you not to go down there!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well he made Rachel cry!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel always cries!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s not true! (Starts to cry.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like
you&#146;ve never sucked before!</p>

and I until you get settled.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Go!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns
around) I mean I&#146;ll have to check with him first, but I&#146;ll think he&#146;ll be

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the gang's all there. Ross has a slip of paper that he throws on
the ground tying to get Rachel's attention.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that
girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a
really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore
him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores
him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely
Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face.
Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it
to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the next morning. Chandler, Monica, Ross, and Rachel are there.]</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> When's your birthday?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> May fifth, why?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, mine's December...</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Yeah, whatever. (Walks away)</p>

<p>(Chandler is talking to Monica and notices a beautiful woman.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the
worst thing that could happen?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I could die.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to <em>Chucky Cheese</em>,
and you didn't even kiss her.</p>

<p>(Ross glares at Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in
bed, and stay there.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all
I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table,
and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Just be yourself. But, not too much.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (loudly) Good luck!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting
over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh Kathy, with K or a C?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> With a K.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-oh-hey!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Wow! You are really good at this.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm
waiting for a date. (Joey enters) Oh, and there he is now.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how
I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze
in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People.
(Starts to sing) <em>Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you?</em> (Stops
singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) <em>Smelly cat, smelly</em>--(stops singing)
Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is walking into the living room having just
gotten up in the middle of the night.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over
the remote.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted
to watch.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God! That's why I got up too!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> You're kidding! Oh, I love him.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've
known you guys were... I never would've...</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh please!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to
do; all of them had us making out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse
with him.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> (laughs) Oh-oh-oh-oh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is it on?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, but this wonder broom is amazing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh! It's on! It's on!</p>

<p>(Chandler jumps into the canoe and sits down. The chick starts chirping and Chandler
reaches down to pick him up.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There we go little fella.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> (laughs) What about the duck?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well the duck can swim.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh, jeez. (Hits him)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the next night, Phoebe is finishing up her set.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing, drunk) <em>My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you
stick on me, ba-a-by!</em> Thanks for the lights honey. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> Way to go, Phoebe!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That cold makes you sound so great.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, have fun!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to
help sick hamsters.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what, I like Kathy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, she's...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she
said the funniest thing about--what? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You love her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I don't.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, Pheebs lay off him.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you, Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Ohh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (turning around and doing that, &quot;I'm making out with someone,&quot;
thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and
sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are there.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy
voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when
you were 14?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that
&quot;Woo-hoo&quot; thing.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel's not here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How's it going with her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah,
the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I
break open a bottle of wine, and do a little &quot;playing&quot; ourselves.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my
friends, and that's Ross.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi, Josh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Dudes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for
the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)</p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's
right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.</p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna...
head.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a
passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.</p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Dope! (exits)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, cute one!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Very!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun
relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot
in a museum.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the
adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What was that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica knows.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our
parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I
cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was
actually cooler than my older brother.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date
tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her
voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to
sing) <em>My sticky shoes</em>--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!</p>

<p>[Scene: Amanda's apartment, Ross is arriving with Ben.]</p>

<p><b>Amanda:</b> (opening the door) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Amanda:</b> Hi Ben!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! You-you look great!</p>

<p><b>Amanda:</b> Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.</p>

<p><b>Amanda:</b> I am so glad that you could come over tonight.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.</p>

<p><b>Amanda:</b> Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please
help yourself to anything in the fridge.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Amanda:</b> I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for
like a month.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I-I-I...</p>

<p><b>Amanda:</b> (noticing the bottle of wine he has) Oh, I don't mean to be a square,
but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh
uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. (She leaves)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who wants to make some long distance calls?</p>

<p>[Scene: A street, Chandler is buying a newspaper and notices Kathy running by.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps
running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to <em>The Mod Squad</em> starts to
play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a
hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs,
in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the
chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to
get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out
of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of
cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I just wanted to say, &quot;Hey!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is telling Monica about his new baby sitting job.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)</p>

<p>(Phoebe runs into the kitchen with wet hair, opens the window, and sticks her head
outside.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be
easy, supposedly they're pretty common.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know?
I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he
waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you
Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!</p>

<p>(Joey and Kathy enter, laughing)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> (to Chandler) We were just talking about you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with
your head in the toilet.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (laughs) Right in there!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with the chick and
the duck.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that
the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the
concept one more time.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and
Kathy tonight?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's 4:30.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me
straight through the week.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, I see what's going on here.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You-you do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! You don't like Kathy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You got me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I
made an <strong>effort</strong> to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an
effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But
that's only because you're not eating anything, right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning from a date with Josh, and when they
get the door open, Rachel turns and passionately kisses Josh.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!</p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna
marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I think he's stealing from me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because he's stealing from me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he
looks so yummy in your leather jacket.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ughh! (Storms out after him)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And
there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you so much Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing with those?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sorry, Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's okay. How's the soup?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm. (nodding her head, &quot;Good.&quot;)</p>

<p>(Monica sets the soup down and Phoebe picks it up and licks the rim.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohhhh!! Gross!!</p>

<p>[Scene: A nightclub, Chandler is having dinner with Kathy and Joey.]</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Is she great or what?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> (to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Not your type?! She's gorgeous!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know?
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet
stockings.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have
a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uhh, no-no thanks.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a
deal.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, look, what do you want from me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then
the least you can do is pretend.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am pretending.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well then, do it better!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?
(Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking
about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm
so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every
minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her
first!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one
of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh,
I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well where's Amanda?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go
up to your old room, and not make out.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, cough drops, please?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry
I forgot, she's not a lesbian.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You see Amanda and I have a very special...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her
baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And what are you laughing at, Miss
`My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'</p>

<p>(Ross starts laughing)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something
with it! (Shows her, her ring)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And
get me my cough drops!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks
in my relationship.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know...</p>

<p>(She does Ross's little gesture. In response Ross puts his hands behind his neck with
his arms sticking straight out and starts flapping them together.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there with her guitar.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) <em>Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street.
Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats</em>. (to Gunther) Does it even work
without my sexy voice?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> I like it. (sneezes)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Gunther, kiss me.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> What?</p>

<p>(Phoebe grabs Gunther and kisses him. He then falls to the couch in shock.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching TV as Joey and Kathy are laughing in
Joey's bedroom. They get to be pretty loud so Chandler turns the TV way up.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board
over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually
gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, with a blanket draped over her shoulders, opens
the door to a similarly clad Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can I sleep on your couch?</p>

<p>(Monica nods `Yes.' And they both walk to the couch looking all depressed.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is singing, with everyone else present.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) <em>And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man</em>. Thank
you my babies.</p>

<p>(applause)</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the
other day_</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't
stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (confused) Okay.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> So umm, are we cool?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (really confused) Okay.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> I knew you'd understand.</p>

<p>(Gunther walks away, leaving Rachel with a `What just happened?' look on her face.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and a beautiful blonde (Cheryl) are standing outside. The
rest of the gang is watching from inside.] </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> So, thank you for the delicious dinner. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> You're welcome for a delicious dinner. </p>

<p>[inside] </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Hey what are you guys looking at? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Ross and the most beautiful girl in <strong>the world</strong>. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, come to papa. </p>

<p>[Cheryl walks away and Ross walks inside. Everyone stares at him in disbelief.] </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> I know! </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the <strong>ass</strong>
on her? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of
Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that? </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics
instructor, what? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the
centazoic era. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her
dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow. </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can
bring home the biggest geek. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Fine by me; hope she wins. </p>
<b>

<p align="center">Opening Credits</b></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Chandler enters.] </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper? </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Oo! Is it for my birthday present? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just
hasn't come yet? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Well, I have a call in about that. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> 'Kay. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her
favorite book. </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Oh, <i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i>! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the
rabbit real! </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils. </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair.<b> </b>So this
is pretty rare. How did you get that? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked
to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Oh, honey, that's so sweet. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, and what a great way to say, &quot;I secretly love you, roommate's
girlfriend!&quot; </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler: </b>It doesn't say that. Does it? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross: </b>How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly
meaningful <strong>and</strong> expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something
really great. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow! </p>
<b>

<p>Monica: </b>(Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am
sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for
sixty people. </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! What happened? </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Sixty <strong>guests</strong>. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> So, uh, why did you have to turn it down? </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that
big on such short notice. I mean there's no way. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not
Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing
around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not? </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> I don't know. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend
you money, but just get moving! </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and
stuff. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in
months. </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Well, you're not working either. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Yes, but I'm doing this. </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you! </p>

<p>[Joey enters] </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Hey! </p>
<b>

<p>Everyone:</b> Hey. </p>
<b>

<p>Kathy:</b> Can I borrow the keys to your apartment? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Why? </p>

<p>[Kathy whispers something in Joey's ear] </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> You can pee here! </p>
<b>

<p>Kathy:</b> Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the
bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her
something? </p>
<b>

<p>Everyone:</b> Yeah! </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Oh, I know... </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> And not one of your coupons for an hour of &quot;Joey Love.&quot; </p>

<p>[cut to a new scene, also in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting, Phoebe
is nearby.] </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Ooo, a crossword! Can I help? </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers
and I really want to finish a whole one without any help. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language. </p>

<p>[Monica enters] </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Hey! </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Hey, how'd it go? </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food,
and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow&#151;the dead-guy-from-today's
best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident! </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Mon! I'm so happy for you! </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.<b> </b>(Picks up two frying
pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order! </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> I'll have one, please. Plus my money. </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you
told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this
stuff. But look&#151;I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I
make from that. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank. </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Okay. </p>

<p>[Scene: Outside Cheryl's apartment, Ross and Cheryl are kissing] </p>
<b>

<p>Ross: </b>(moved by the kiss) Huh... </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> Um, would you like to come in? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools? </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> According to recent findings! </p>

<p>[They go into the apartment. Inside the apartment it looks like a sewage dump exploded
and landed in her living room. There are clothes and food and junk covering every square
inch of space. I mean pigs have nicer pens. Ross is completely shocked.]</p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> (throwing food around the room) Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi! </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Mitzi is..... </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> (mouths &quot;where?&quot;) Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage
and falters) ...do you have any<b>, </b>um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties? </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> What? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles,
break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh... </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> I'd rather not. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah, why not? </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird
smell. </p>

<p>[Scene: A kitchen where Phoebe and Monica are finishing up a catering job] </p>
<b>

<p>Monica: </b>Oh, is everything in the car? </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Yes. Did you settle the bill? </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> No. I hate this part. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker) </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> No, that's not mine. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took! </p>

<p>[cut to the living room of the same dwelling, where the funeral guests are mingling.
Monica enters.] </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen. </p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Burkart:</b> Oh, good. Thank you. </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of... </p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Burkart:</b> Dear? </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Just the matter of ...payment? </p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (in grief) Jack used to handle the finances! (Breaks into tears) </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is on the couch still doing the crossword. Chandler
is in the kitchen.] </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> You know what we should all do? Go see a musical. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> (confused) Sure... </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you
happen to know the name of that one? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> I don't know... um, Grease? </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No.... </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Rent? </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yes! Rent! </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Okay, so when do you want to go? </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> (entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yes, it is, at <i>Office Max</i>. </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a
pen.) </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> A <strong>pen</strong>.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Huh-huh! You can't give her that. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Why not? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah! </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift,
maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over....
&quot;Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!&quot; </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio
for her birthday? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> She didn't have a birthday while we were going out. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> For three years? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> (whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an
audition. I can't shop anymore! I... </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Would you like me to write her a little poem as well? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it. </p>

<p>[Scene: Back in the kitchen at the funeral. Phoebe is there, Monica enters.] </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> But Mon, you have to get our money! </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears
looked giant. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's
funeral was? </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> What? </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some
people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, &quot;that massage
wasn't long enough, or, &quot;I don't recognize any of those songs,&quot; or, you know,
&quot;these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!&quot; </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking? </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me. </p>

<p>[cut to the living room where Mrs. Burkart is now performing.] </p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (singing) You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and
forever in peace may you wave.... </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> She seems fine now. </p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (singing) ...emblem of the land I love. The home of.... </p>

<p align="center"></b><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are standing and talking, Ross is tying a
tie.] </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> So, you just left? Her place was really that bad? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Yeah. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead
of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of
time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands
it to Joey who puts it on.) Here. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> All right, so... next time, you take her to your place. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> What kind of smell? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> I don't know. <i>Soap</i>? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Yeah. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> You wanna see her again, right? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Yeah. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> So you're gonna have to do it in the mess! </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Yeah, okay you're right. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Yeah. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Yeah! </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> It's, uh... it's endearing, really. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure)
Oink! </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel, Rachel is there, Chandler enters.] </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present
for Kathy that would be better than <i>the rabbit</i>. </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Any luck? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called &quot;Invisible things
for Kathy.&quot; (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a
hand with all this stuff? </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the
clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her
to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her. </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Aw, honey, that's so sweet. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic? </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.) </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over
for you! </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Where? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Our place, the hall! I... </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to
his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book! </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> (Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a
safe? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the <i>Velveteen
Rabbit</i>. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes
it, okay? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves,
comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> No, it came out to an even twenty. </p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Wow. That's almost as much as a <i>new</i> book. </p>

<p>[Scene: In the living room at the funeral] </p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (singing) Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers,
creepers, where'd you get those eyes? </p>

<p>[cut to Monica and Phoebe in the kitchen] </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> You didn't get the money, did you? </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's
just go! </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks
she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow? </p>

<p>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (Singing) Come on along and listen to... </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Okay, Widow! </p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (Singing) ...the lullabye of... </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this
is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to
be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid
every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place
else to go. </p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Burkart:</b> All right. I'll get my bag. </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with
everyone staring at her.) </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event. </p>

<b>

<p>Ross:</b> (mustering up courage) Yes. Yes I do. (They go inside.) </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable. (Ross attempts to clear a
place for his coat and fold it small enough to fit. Then hit sits on the couch. Something
falls on him from above and he brushes his neck off frantically.) </p>

<p>Ross:</b> Department of Sanitation? </p>

<p>Cheryl:</b> It's me! </p>

<p>Ross:</b> Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch.
Ross's hand moves under some garbage) Aw! (His hand is covered with something brown and
gooey.) </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> What? </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> (trying to make his disgust into lust) Ah, Cheryl! </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> Oh, Ross! </p>

<p>[They sit up, moaning in excitement, and Cheryl straddles Ross. Ross finds a slice of
bologna and moans higher and louder, then a bag of potato chips on the coffee table starts
to move. Ross throws Cheryl off his lap, grabs a tennis racket and a toilet brush and
starts pounding the bag.] </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi! </p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out. </p>
<b>

<p>Cheryl:</b> (looking in the bag) Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat. </p>

puzzle. Gunther is there, going into the back room.] </p>

<p>Rachel:</b> I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to

<p>Monica:</b> Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she
did. </p>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. I'm a hard ass. </p>

catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such
a great time together! </p>

<p>Kathy:</b> No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Uh, the book? </p>
<b>

<p>Kathy:</b> <i>The Velveteen Rabbit.</i> I kinda have the feeling you had something to
do with it. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> What do you mean? </p>
<b>

<p>Kathy:</b> Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, &quot;This is 'cause I know ya
like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese.&quot; Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it
must have been for you to find. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> (tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound
was, &quot;Uhl, ell.&quot; </p>
<b>

<p>Kathy:</b> You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend. </p>
<b>

<p>Kathy:</b> Well.... </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Goodnight. (Goes to his room.) </p>

<p>Joey:</b> (opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know. </p>

<p>Monica:</b> Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister. </p>

<p>Cheryl:</b> Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out. </p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep,
thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it? </p>

<p>Monica:</b> No? </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey and Chandler are there eating
breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy
naked! It was like torture!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know if we ever go to war and you&#146;re captured, you&#146;re in for a
<strong>big</strong> surprise.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it&#146;s bad
enough that I&#146;m in love with my roommates girlfriend&#151;which by the way, I think
she knows. Because every time we&#146;re in the room together there&#146;s this weird like
energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen
her naked. I mean at least when I&#146;ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her
body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she&#146;s smooth!
Smooth! (leaves)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! Oh my God!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is getting a phone number from a woman (Casey) as Chandler
watches from the doorway.]</p>

<p><b>Casey:</b> Here you go.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Great! All right, so I&#146;ll call you later.</p>

<p><b>Casey:</b> Great! (leaves)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That would be Casey. We&#146;re going out tonight.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Goin&#146; out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So
things didn&#146;t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, things are fine with Kathy. I&#146;m having a late dinner with her
tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (shocked) What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by
myself! (Laughs)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wait! You&#146;re going out with Kathy!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&#146;m upset&#151;for you. I mean, having sex with an endless
line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can&#146;t believe he just
sad that.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What is the big deal? It&#146;s not like we&#146;re exclusive.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But
Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that
she&#146;s-she&#146;s smart, and funny, and gets you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You got all that from the back of her head?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right look, I think it&#146;s time for you to settle down. Y'know?
Make a choice, pick a lane.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who&#146;s Elaine?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are sitting on the couch playing cards,
and Phoebe is working on a new song.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) &quot;<em>Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair.
Swinging with the greatest of ease&#133;</em>&quot; Darn it! Now, I don&#146;t know who to
get to the next verse.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you could just go uh, &quot;<em>greatest of ease</em>&#133; (plays air
guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn.&quot; Then go right into it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about
&#145;bah-bah-bha-bhan?&#146;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well umm, y&#146;know, I used to play.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah, that&#146;s right, the keyboards, huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in
college. I mean that&#146;s-that&#146;s when I really found my sound.</p>

<p>(Monica is taking a drink as Ross says that, laughs, and snorts her drink.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth
it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every
allowed to hear, &quot;The Sound.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I wanna hear &quot;The Sound.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven&#146;t played in so long, and-and, well
it&#146;s-it&#146;s really personal stuff, y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, play that funky music white boy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in&#151;No, yeah,
okay. (Runs out.)</p>

<p>[Cut to later that same day, Ross has retrieved his keyboard and is about to debut,
&quot;The Sound.&quot;]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, guys.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! Bring it on, you&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Here we go. (Plays one note) Y&#146;know, I&#146;ve-I&#146;ve never played
my stuff for anyone before, so it&#146;s important that-that you understand it&#146;s
about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y&#146;know, umm, you
should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That&#146;s what
I&#146;m&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!</p>

<p>(Ross starts to play. He plays a key that has a back beat sound attached to it. Over
the background music he plays the sound of a barking dog, a mooing cow, a laser beam,
someone coughing, a jackhammer, a doorbell, a police siren, a ray gun, breaking dishes,
and for a closer he plays the sound of a loud crash. Basically, the music sucks.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm&#133; terrific.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really, bitchin&#146;!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, it was so&#151;wow!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?! I mean, really?!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! Thanks, you guys. That&#146;s uh&#151;ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you
another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I&#146;ll be
right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I&#146;m&#151;I am so&#133;
(starts to break up and leaves)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I can&#146;t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus
it&#146;s just, it&#146;s so different from the stuff you usually hear.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean like, music?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching Yasmein Bleeth running on TV, and the
duck starts quacking.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know what you&#146;re thinkin&#146;! Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come in!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> (entering) Hey! (sees what&#146;s on TV) Oh God, is that <em>Baywatch</em>?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> So is Joey around?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, he&#146;s not back yet, but he&#146;ll be here any minute. So
uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> I uh, don&#146;t really have a preference. You?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) &#133;of the
boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it&#146;s me. Listen Casey and I
were on our way back and had a little car trouble.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some
transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I&#146;ll be there as
soon as I can.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why can&#146;t you tell her?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> &#145;Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about
to&#151;(he stops talking suddenly)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey! Joey!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I thought your time ran out.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more&#151;(his time runs out for
real)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He&#146;s running a little late, he
says he&#146;s sorry.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So I guess it&#146;s just uh, you and me then.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I think it is!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> So what did you do today?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut&#133;</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> (interrupting) Oh, it looks great!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> &#133;and then it got canceled.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Well, I could cut it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?! You do that?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt&#146;s dog grooming shop, but
hey, what do you say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don&#146;t make my tail too poofy.</p>

<p>[Cut to later, Kathy is cutting Chandler&#146;s hair.]</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> You have really great hair.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through
his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y&#146;know who also has
great hair is Joey!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I&#146;m basically done here. Just
let me get this off your neck.</p>

<p>(Kathy leans in really close and Chandler mouths &quot;Oh my God.&quot; She moves
around in front of him and kneels at his feet.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What-what &#145;cha doin&#146;?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Checking to see if it&#146;s even.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> &#145;Kay.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Looks good.</p>

<p>(They lean in to kiss and are interrupted by the phone.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone&#146;s making
sounds! (On phone) Hello!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Hey dude, it&#146;s me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey it&#146;s Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen uh, I&#146;m really sorry, it looks like I&#146;m gonna be stuck
here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the
transmission wasn&#146;t there!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, it must&#146;ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit
a dog.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> (on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no it&#146;s fine, don&#146;t worry about
it. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it&#146;s okay. (listens) Yeah! I&#146;ll talk to
you tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Yes! Yeah. </p>

<p>(Kathy leaves and Chandler groans in agony. Kathy knocks on the door and Chandler opens
it.)</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> I forgot my purse.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. </p>

<p>(They kiss, passionately.)</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, I really did forget my purse.</p>

<p>(They kiss again.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, continued from earlier. Chandler and Kathy are still
kissing, then they stop suddenly.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no-no, this is bad! It&#146;s bad! This is bad!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Horrible!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> No-no-no, the kiss was good.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, but that&#146;s bad!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here&#146;s what we do, we-we forget it happened.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we&#146;re unhappy
forever. Sound good?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Can you really do that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I have to; he&#146;s my best friend, and you&#146;re seeing him.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don&#146;t! Don&#146;t! See-see,
you&#146;re getting me confused, I&#146;m starting to urn. </p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> I&#146;m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I-I think we have too.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Okay. Bye.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against
the door.) Are you still out there?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> (outside the door) No. (Chandler opens the door and they kiss again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is performing, his music hasn&#146;t improved.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays
the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there&#146;s a <em>Starbucks</em> about
three blocks down.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (pushing Monica back onto the couch) It&#146;s so inspired! Look at him!
Look at him go!</p>

<p>[cut back to Ross who finally finishes his so-called song with the same crash from
before. He gets some applause, mainly &#145;cause he&#146;s done.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Phoebe) Hey, aren&#146;t you up next?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, I&#146;m not playing tonight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&#146;t follow Ross! It&#146;d be like those bicycle ridding chimps
that followed <em>The Beetles</em>. No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, Ross sucks! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, he&#146;s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give
anything to not be appreciated in my own time!</p>

<p>(Rachel and Monica look at each other, and agree on something without saying anything.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, Phoebe you&#146;re&#133; awful!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is opening the door, but Chandler has the chain on
it.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Aww man! I can&#146;t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the
door.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to
reveal a fully furnished apartment.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I sure did.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I just thought it&#146;d make me feel good to do something nice
for my friend.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you&#146;re amazing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no. <strong>This</strong> is amazing. (He goes over and
presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing
the TV.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That&#146;s the dream!
Man, how did you afford this stuff?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y&#146;know I&#146;m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey
listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I&#146;m
gonna do that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean with Casey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no, I think I&#146;m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She&#146;s
pretty cool.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Or Casey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, Kathy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Could be Casey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No. No, Kathy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Consider Casey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&#146;know what I think? I think somebody&#146;s got a little crush on
Casey. How &#145;bout I fix you two up? What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross has just finished playing.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Phoebe) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don&#146;t want to
play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I-I can&#146;t&#151;I mean y&#146;know I was trying to be really
y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just&#151;I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.
I&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
Y&#146;know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I&#133;
I won&#146;t play anymore.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no. No-no-no, don&#146;t do that! How could I live with myself if I
knew I was depriving the world of your music.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are sitting on the couch and Phoebe is getting
coffee as Chandler enters. Ross is also there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I kissed Kathy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does Joey know?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. Is there anyway, <strong>anyway</strong> you think he&#146;ll
understand this?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You obviously haven&#146;t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all
look at her) Which we all appreciate.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you
kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would&#146;ve just stepped aside.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, don&#146;t say that! Don&#146;t say that. That&#146;s not true. Is
it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think maybe, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He loves you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then why didn&#146;t you tell me to do that?!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! No, that&#146;s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I remember that!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I remember you did.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, Chandler, you&#146;re gonna have to tell him.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because you do.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Samboucha Margarita? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is that a real thing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What&#146;s up?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s-it&#146;s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot
actually.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You do?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you&#146;re timing couldn&#146;t be better. She&#146;s not my
girlfriend anymore.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, she broke up with me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh uh, when?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind
of scene, that&#146;s why I let people watch.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I&#146;ve been better. But, I&#146;m all right. So you like her huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, but I-I uh, don&#146;t have too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no, no it&#146;s uh, it&#146;s okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. You know why? &#145;Cause you came to me first.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you&#146;re work cut out
for you. &#145;Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she&#146;s into
some other guy. So&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> See uh, that&#146;s-that&#146;s actually what I wanted to talk to you
about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s me. I&#146;m the other guy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to
talking, and one thing to another and&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And what?! Did you sleep with her?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! No! No! I just kissed her.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!! That&#146;s even worse!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How is that worse?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know! But it&#146;s the same!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, I&#146;m sorry! But there&#146;s nothing I can do, I think
I&#146;m in love with her!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&#146;re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Over the line?! You-you&#146;re-you&#146;re so far past the line, that
you-you can&#146;t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like
&quot;Well, kinda.&quot;) Well, y&#146;know what I will not watch your TV, I will not
listen to your stereo, and there&#146;s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that
I&#146;m not gonna eat! You know why?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Probably because&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Because it&#146;s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this
apartment is empty for me! And I&#146;m not happy about you either. (The bread maker
dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom
and slams the door.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is playing his music. Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting
on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, he&#146;s lost it. He&#146;s totally lost it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (removing ear plugs) What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, his music could not <strong>get</strong> any worse. There are
rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.</p>

<p>(Ross finally finishes with the same crash, and gets some applause.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.
Y&#146;know, I&#146;m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my
set?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.</p>

<p>(Phoebe gets up and goes to play, Ross goes over and sits down next to Monica and
Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, like I could <strong>lose</strong> it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I played bad on purpose guys.</p>

<p>(Both Monica and Rachel laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah&#151;no, just that last song.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is sitting at the counter reading a magazine as the
phone rings.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (answering phone) Hello.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) Hey, it&#146;s me. I know you can&#146;t stand to be in the
same room as me, so I just thought I&#146;d try and apologize over the phone. All I&#133;
(Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>(The phone rings again.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (answering phone) Hello.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I&#146;m&#133;
(Joey hangs up the phone again.)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>(The phone rings yet again.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (answering phone) Stop callin&#146;!!</p>

<p><b>Voice:</b> (on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily
challenge.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Voice:</b> What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do
anything&#133; (Joey realizes it&#146;s Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone but Joey and Chandler are there getting ready for
Thanksgiving.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look everyone, it&#146;s the spirit of Thanksgiving!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So are things with you and Joey any better?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> They couldn&#146;t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last
night, just trying to get him to talk to me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those
plug-in telephone headsets huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Should we <strong>all</strong> expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen
from your office?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You shouldn&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new
business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then
we each only buy one gift. And-and there&#146;s the added mystery of who gets who.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don&#146;t know why I do that.</p>

<p>[Cut to later, the gang, minus Joey, is watching the Thanksgiving Day parade.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I&#146;m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We haven&#146;t eaten yet!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, but all that work you&#146;re doing to get it ready, I
just&#133; (goes into her bedroom.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,
&#145;cause I wanna trade for her.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it&#146;s like
impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let&#146;s trade!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that&#146;s not true! That&#146;s not true! I got her that backpack
and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off
with it&#133; (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe&#146;s faces.) Oh, there was no big
dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on
it&#133; (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Op, y'know what though, it&#146;s kind&#146;ve a girlie briefcase.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Who cares? He works in a museum!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You don&#146;t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren&#146;t here, you can
watch the parade if you want.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and
a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God, what happened?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Open it up, let me see.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, y&#146;know what, I can&#146;t, it really kills.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well maybe you should put some ice on it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, God it looks bad.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can&#146;t go to him when I don&#146;t
have a boyfriend!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He&#146;s really picky about his patients.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Honey, you&#146;ve got to go. What&#146;s his office number?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I&#146;m calling on behalf of Monica Geller&#146;s
eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He&#146;s out of town,
but does she want to see the on-call doctor?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes! She&#146;s very excited about that.</p>

<p>[Cut to later, Phoebe is adding butter to something and Ross is watching.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is so cool, &#145;til Monica gets back, it&#146;s like I&#146;m
head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and
then decides to add it to the dish.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, get out of my kitchen!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with
Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed
the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right I&#133; I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking
question.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I&#146;m already
getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh y&#146;know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?! Wow! That&#146;s-that&#146;s so nice, what are you gonna get me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your
office.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no, you don&#146;t want to do that, then you&#146;re gonna
get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, that&#146;s not true! I&#146;ve got her lots of stuff she never took
back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Like?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> When was the last time you saw her wear it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Big dog?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is repacking the furniture into boxes to return it.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Everything? Even the TV?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! I&#146;m putting that in my room.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don&#146;t you think you
could at least hear the guy out?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would
you hear him out?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Five years. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You&#146;ve sentenced him?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Don&#146;t do the crime if you can&#146;t do the time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey, the guy&#146;s your best friend.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, <strong>was</strong> my best friend. Anyway, I don&#146;t know why
you&#146;re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend,
there&#146;s a spot open.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, who? Me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! I&#146;m honored! And y&#146;know what I&#146;m gonna do as my first
act as your best friend?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. But if you weren&#146;t my best friend.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are sitting at a table and talking about
Joey.]</p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> Oh my God, is it really that bad?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I walk into a room and he won&#146;t even talk to me, he just mumbles
something in Italian. And I<strong> know</strong> he only knows the bad words.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?</p>

<p><strong>Gunther:</strong> I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over
there.</p>

<p>(Joey turns around and sees them kissing.)</p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey Joe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Dr. Burke&#146;s office, Rachel and Monica are waiting as the doctor arrives.]</p>

<p><b>Doctor:</b> I&#146;ll be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, so cute, that I&#146;m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.</p>

<p>(The intercom buzzes.)</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> Dr. Burke will see you know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call
doctor will see me now.</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see
you now.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Timothy Burke:</b> Ready?</p>

<p>(Monica looks at Rachel, who gives her the thumbs up.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is packing as Chandler rushes in.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! I&#146;m sorry! That&#151;(sees that Joey is about to leave)
where are you going?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> My folks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an
apartment.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, y&#146;know at first I thought we could talk about this y&#146;know,
work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don&#146;t think I&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that
I&#146;ll stop seeing her?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, it&#146;s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just
reminds me of what you did. And I don&#146;t want to live with some one who doesn&#146;t
know what it is to be a friend. So, I&#146;ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler
grabs his bag and stops him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! You did! And that&#146;s why I&#146;m leaving.</p>

<p>(The chick and the duck walk into the living room.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right look, if you&#146;re not gonna stay for me, then at least
stay for them! Okay, they have had a <strong>very</strong> difficult year! What with the
robbery and all!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about
how I let you down! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! But if would&#146;ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn
out to be, I wouldn&#146;t have worried about it so much! See you around!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be
something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in
it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We&#146;ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Dr. Burke&#146;s office, Tim is examining Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were
just standing outside <em>The Dairy Queen</em>.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I was probably waiting for it to open.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> I gotta tell you, you look great now.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You look great too.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> You&#146;re an excellent patient!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So how does it look?</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Well, you&#146;ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to
wear a patch for a couple of days.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Like a pirate?!</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> If that helps you. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her)
Come on, one of us had to mention him.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> I moved back here a couple of months ago.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. Big family dinner tonight?</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No way!</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend&#146;s.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (disappointed) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> But we broke up.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (happy) Oh. </p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> She-she wasn&#146;t ready for a serious commitment.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate&#146;s voice) So you made her walk the
plank? Aye, matie?</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> You&#146;re not wearing the patch yet.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, It&#146;s closer to dinner. Monica has just told everyone
that Tim is coming to dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He&#146;s coming here for Thanksgiving!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, it&#146;s sick.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why is it sick?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because it&#146;s Richard&#146;s son! It&#146;s like inviting Greek
tragedy over for dinner!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don&#146;t you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I can see where I&#146;d be your best shot but, no. I&#146;m
sorry, but I think it&#146;s twisted.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (coming out of the bathroom) What&#146;s twisted?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Me going out with Richard&#146;s son.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad
idea to me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is he okay in there?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He&#146;s fine!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard&#146;s son,
you&#146;d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian,
(points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice
dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl&#146;s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler)
livin&#146; in a box!! (goes to her room)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So now, what exactly is the point of the box?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through
the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another
finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a
third finger), it hurts!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last
year? Can I see it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (worried) Why?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I just wanna check something.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we&#146;ll
see.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I
wear it all the time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is
silver.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well isn&#146;t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy
and that I can get a lot of use out of?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What did you get?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Credit. </p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (running in from her bedroom) I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it!
I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it!
I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it!
I&#146;ll get it! I&#146;ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe. </p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Hi, nice to meet you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Hi, Joey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> My brother, Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that&#146;s Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How do ya do.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> What&#146;s&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, well, he&#146;s&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He&#146;s doin&#146; some thinkin&#146;!</p>

<p>[cut to later, Joey, Rachel, Ross, and Tim are watching the football game, and they all
cheer loudly.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What happened? What happened?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You kissed my girlfriend!</p>

<p>(A commercial for sunglasses comes on.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, I like those sunglasses.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Like &#145;em, like &#145;em? Or, I&#146;d like to get store credit for
that amount like &#145;em?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Swears in Italian, it&#146;s the same term used by Joey earlier and
Joey nods his approval.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right everybody, this turkey is ready!</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Where can I wash up?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink,
and umm, you can use the fancy soap.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Fancy soap? I thought we were savin&#146; that for the Pope!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> See he&#146;s nice. Right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you
can actually use the phrase, &quot;That&#146;s not how your dad used to do it.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a loud knocking.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I&#146;ll get it. (goes over to the door.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Gotcha! (laughs)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That doesn&#146;t sound like thinking to me!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&#146;know I don&#146;t think you should be talking at all in there! I
think you&#146;ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay, you got it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, can you pass me the yams?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure! Oh, and Joey&#146;s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange
them.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh-ho-ho, we&#146;ve got company.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There&#146;s nothing the matter with me. See, I&#146;m not completely
devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)</p>

<p>(an awkward silence follows)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can&#146;t tell, but I&#146;m trying to break the tension by
mooning you guys!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,
all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn&#146;t mean anything to you, then
you should get out of there, otherwise you&#146;re just an idiot in a box!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&#146;re right, and I&#146;m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want
you to be my friend again! I swear, I won&#146;t say another word tonight.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Absolutely!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?
(There&#146;s no response from Chandler.) Okay.</p>

<p>(Rachel comes back carrying a shoe box.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Don&#146;t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross
what&#146;s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell
from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the
museum from the first time we&#133; were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t know what to say, I&#146;m sorry. Though, you&#146;re not
supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It&#146;s like a million years old, we, we
actually, we had people looking for that.</p>

<p>(Rachel glares at him.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the balcony with Monica and Tim.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Here, let me help. (Does so.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> You-you have a very beautiful&#133; eye.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know all my friends think this is weird. </p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Y&#146;know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and
canceled, but it really isn&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know! I mean it&#146;s like me and your dad, that&#146;s a totally
separate thing.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Oh, I totally agree.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We&#146;re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?</p>

<p>(Tim leans in to kiss her. They stop, and when he tries to kiss her again, Monica pulls
away.)</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing. Nothing.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> No-no really, was-was that not okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss&#133;</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Oh my God! It didn&#146;t remind you of&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting) Don&#146;t say it!</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> No, but it did! Didn&#146;t it?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b> Oh man!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know!</p>

<p>(They both shiver in horror.)</p>

<p>[cut to later, Tim has left. Monica is still shivering. There&#146;s a knock on the
door.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;ll get it. (It&#146;s Kathy.)</p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> (sees it&#146;s Joey) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s okay. Chandler&#146;s the one I&#146;m mad at.</p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> Well, I&#146;m still sorry. Is he here?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> In the box.</p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> (going over to the box) Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, he-he can&#146;t talk right now.</p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> Why not? What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He&#146;s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.</p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> By being in a box?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, had reasons. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They were threefold.</p>

<p><strong>Kathy:</strong> Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make
this easier. Listen umm&#133; (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the hint
and leave them alone.) Listen I don&#146;t wanna be someone who comes between two best
friends. I just, I can&#146;t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I
don&#146;t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don&#146;t think we can see each other
anymore. I&#146;m gonna go to my mom&#146;s in Chicago, I&#146;m gonna stay there for
awhile. I think this could&#146;ve be something really amazing, but y&#146;know this is
probably for the best. Y&#146;know? I&#146;m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler. </p>

<p>(She gets up and leaves, Chandler waves good-bye with one finger extended through the
air hole. Ross glares at Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get
out of there!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, we&#146;re gonna be fine! Get out!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you did some real good thinkin&#146; in there.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Man, this is&#133; </p>

<p>(Joey says something unintelligible and they hug.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now go! &#145;Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from
you&#146;re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.) </p>

<p>(After he&#146;s gone.) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, who got Chandler? &#145;Cause I uh, need to trade.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, the gang is all there watching Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, he sees her!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, he&#146;s catching up to her!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, she sees him! Oh, they&#146;re hugging!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He&#146;s taking her purse!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, that&#146;s not them. I&#146;m gonna go call the police.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, there they are!</p>

<p>(They watch them making up and sigh)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, get a room.</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are showing everyone the van they
bought for the catering business. It&#146;s an old Dodge van, that has a cartoon woman
riding on a dragon painted on the side of it.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands
over their eyes.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Our eyes are closed and we&#146;re about to cross the street. Very
good.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okayyyyy, open up! </p>

<p>(They open their eyes and are stunned at the van.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this <strong>bitchin'</strong>
van!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, it&#146;s for our catering business!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I think I know that girl.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, umm, we&#146;re not gonna really keep it this way though.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, we&#146;re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a
baguette. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And also, we don&#146;t know what to do with this. (She turns on a
switch and the girl&#146;s nipples light up.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, I definitely know her.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is all there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that
put cilantro with everything?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I&#146;m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea
Reporter.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence&#133; dozens of
people.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How could you say yes, what about our catering business?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no-no-no, it&#146;s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all
of you out for a <strong>lot</strong> of free dinners.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yay!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, in that case&#151;(hops up and down in joy)&#151;Yay! (Monica looks
confused) That was me hopping on board.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you
ready to party?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but
there&#146;s this thing about bumblebees on <em>The Discovery Channel</em> that I was
planning to watch.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, I don&#146;t think you heard me. Are you ready to <strong>party</strong>?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Kathy&#146;s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we
are partying with Gandolf dude!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Dude, we are<strong> sooo</strong> gonna party!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mike &quot;Gandolf&quot; Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m gonna call after you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Ross:</b> Woooo!!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with
me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, why do you call him Gandolf?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn&#146;t you read <em>Lord
of the Rings</em> in high school?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I had sex in high school.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, Rachel and Sophie are sitting at their desks working as
Joanna walks in.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something.
There&#146;s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> (interrupting) Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people
all day and&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can&#146;t stay my assistant
forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> God, I am so glad you don&#146;t have a problem with this, because if
you did, I wouldn&#146;t even <strong>consider</strong> applying.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Really? Well, in that case&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting) And that&#146;s I&#146;m so glad&#133; there&#146;s no
problem.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> That&#146;s fine, actually I&#146;m on the hiring committee, so
there&#146;ll be at least one friendly face.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! That&#146;s great!</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the <strong>ugliest</strong>
guy to get that job.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> No-ho-ho! (pause) Yeah. (pause) I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don&#146;t you
worry, I&#146;m sure with your qualifications you won&#146;t need to sleep with some guy
to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I, umm&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Kidding! God, I feel wild today!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is getting ready to party.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh man! I am so excited&#151;I may vomit!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Will you calm down, he&#146;s just a human guy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look you don&#146;t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y&#146;know
you&#146;re never know what&#146;s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of
beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, it&#146;s beautiful country up there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite
kit!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s not gonna be <strong>exactly</strong> like last time.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I&#146;ll see you guys.</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Ross:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I have an audition, but I&#146;ll definitely hook up with you later. Where
are you gonna be around noon?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Somewhere maybe along the equator?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It&#146;s Gandolf!!! (on
phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
(Hangs up)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He&#146;s not gonna make it, he&#146;s stuck in Chicago.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Stupid, useless Canadian money!</p>

<p>[Scene: <em>Bloomingdale&#146;s</em>, Rachel is meeting with Mr. Posner, Mrs. Lynch,
and Joanna the hiring committee.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Posner:</b> You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what
I see here about implementing a new filing system.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put
on all the folders? (to the committee) It certainly did brighten up the inside of the
filing cabinets. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Lynch:</b> I notice that you&#146;ve been trusted with a lot of rather
important responsibilities.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel
for me. It&#146;s amazing how she gets it right almost <strong>every</strong> time!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Oh yes, well there&#146;s the coffee too. (to the committee) Rachel can
carry two things at once!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Posner:</b> Yes, that&#146;s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is
cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, I realize that&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> (interrupting) And Rachel shouldn&#146;t have any problem with that. The
only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I love working with designers!</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> With them, under them, what&#146;s the difference? Eh, Rach?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is there as Monica enters carrying a huge stack of
newspapers.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey! My first review is out!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, look at my on the back page.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay! (reading) &quot;Would I go back to Allesandro&#146;s? Sure,
but I&#146;d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to
my head.&quot; (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, they don&#146;t pay me a penny a word to make friends.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for
catering.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh! Do you need me to go with you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no, it&#146;s okay. But are we sure we don&#146;t want the waterbed?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Haven&#146;t we made this decision?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bye!</p>

<p>(The intercom buzzes.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (answering it) Who is it?</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> It&#146;s Allesandro, from Allesandro&#146;s.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> I want to talk to you about your review.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> Why? So you could hang up on me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, I-I&#146;m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> Just give me a chance too&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Phoebe!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Monica!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> (entering) I want a retraction! Our food is <strong>not</strong>
inedible swill!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I couldn&#146;t eat it! I had five friends who couldn&#146;t eat it, and
one of them eats books.</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> Well our service is not grossly incompetent.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> Well, you said that we except the <em>Discover Card</em>, which we
do not!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, that I&#146;ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food
and that wasn&#146;t it. You&#146;re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should
serve it with vodka and a piece of celery. </p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> Hey! I&#146;m proud of that sauce, it&#146;s delicious.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes
good?! Where are you even from?</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> (shyly) Lebanon.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hand me those tomatoes, I&#146;m gonna show you what it should taste
like! Come on, hand me them.</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> How long is this gonna take? &#145;Cause I got another critic to go
yell at.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, Rachel is confronting Joanna about her interview.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering Joanna&#146;s office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that
interview.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> I thought it went very well.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! It didn&#146;t! That&#146;s what I want to talk to you about.
(starts to break up) Now, just to brief you&#133; (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are
not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Rachel, please, don&#146;t make a scene.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> There&#146;s nobody here!</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Sophie, get in here! (Sophie enters) You see! Now you&#146;re making
Sophie uncomfortable!</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> She&#146;s not making me uncomfortable.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless.
Get out. (Sophie starts to cry and leaves)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you want me to quit?</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> What?! What would make you think that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you
believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y&#146;know what? <strong>I</strong>
am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk,
which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes
she has nothing.) Well, I guess there&#146;s no use to me sticking around &#145;til the
end of the day! (Starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in
it&#146;s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn&#146;t want to lose a perfectly good
assistant.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> That&#146;s why I said all those things about your flirting and your
drinking&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> My drinking? </p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Oh, I must&#146;ve said that after you left.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Said what? Exactly.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> That you enjoyed the occasional drink&#133;ing binge.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I&#146;m leaving! You are just a horrible
person!</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you&#146;re gonna get all
sensitive about it! I don&#146;t want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you?
I&#146;ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Say more things like that.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;d need an expense account.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Done!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And an assistant.</p>

<p><b>Joanna:</b> Sophie, get in here! (Sophie peeks in around the corner)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are watching TV as Joey enters.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you&#146;d be out partying
with Gandel-worf.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s Gandolf, and he&#146;s not coming.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So you&#146;ve been sittin&#146; around here all mornin&#146;?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! I balanced my checkbook. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can&#146;t believe he didn&#146;t come!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So what if he didn&#146;t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-no, y&#146;know with Gandolf we&#146;d be <strong>out</strong> all
night!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! We&#146;d meet, we&#146;d meet total strangers, and hang out with
them!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, we could do that! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There&#146;s other stuff too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We&#146;ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want
to party with us, dude! Come on!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s not like we don&#146;t know how to party!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! All right? Let&#146;s go!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?</p>

<p><b>Joey and Ross:</b> Yeah!!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were
licking your face?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, those were seals, man.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is entering, excited.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on
an assistant buyer?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, the owner of Allesandro&#146;s came over to yell at me, but
instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way
home, but I&#146;m soo happy!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, you&#146;ve waited soo long. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at <em>Bloomingdale&#146;s</em>?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&#146;t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and&#133;
(realizes) You got the job!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes!!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You got the job?! Why didn&#146;t you tell me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, it&#146;s gonna be so great! I&#146;m gonna get to help decide what
we sell, I&#146;m gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica)
I&#146;m gonna have walls!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding
reception.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel
excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from
catering.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But we&#146;ve only had one job.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like
it&#146;s snowballing, y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! What are you saying?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro&#146;s.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s okay, &#145;cause y'know what? You don&#146;t really need me
for the business.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&#146;re the cook! With out you it&#146;s just me driving up to
people&#146;s houses with empty trays and asking for money!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right. But umm, I-I-I&#146;ll pay you back all the money you
invested, <strong>and</strong> you can keep the van.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> For what? I can&#146;t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m an assistant buyer!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Ross, and Chandler are making a pit stop on their party
tour.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, so we&#146;ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and
we&#146;ll head back out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, all right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So, we&#146;re having fun, right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We don&#146;t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to
some strangers, and uh, after this, we&#146;ll head down to the docks and see about that
boat thing.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m kinda beat.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Actually, me too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you serious?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank God! I&#146;m exhausted!</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> So you guys want coffees?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, but uh, I don&#146;t want to be up too late, so uh, I&#146;ll have a
decaf. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, me too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I
strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can&#146;t hear a word you&#146;re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y&#146;know? I used
them as mittens, I didn&#146;t want to touch a <strong>thing</strong> in that last place.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How sad are we?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know what? We&#146;re not sad, we&#146;re not sad, we&#146;re
just not 21 anymore. Y&#146;know? I&#146;m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a
comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!</p>

<p><b>Joey and Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my
friends.</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We&#146;re 29, we&#146;re not women.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the next day, Phoebe is there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Ohh, here you are. Y&#146;know, I&#146;m-I&#146;m glad you
decided to hear me out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I&#146;m hearing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up
with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower
delivery person.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Or! A bakery delivery person.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I wa-I wa-I wa&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Pizza?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, I&#146;ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but
umm, I&#146;m getting the feeling that you don&#146;t want to deliver.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. I&#146;m guessing that if you don&#146;t want to deliver, you
probably don&#146;t want to pick stuff up either.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know what, let&#146;s do the catering business.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?! Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y&#146;know what, it&#146;d
be, it&#146;d be fun.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! It <strong>will</strong> be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let&#146;s
plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and
starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.)
Wow! You <strong>really</strong> wanted me to do something with this van. (pause)
Y&#146;know what, I want you to take the chef job.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. That&#146;s what you really want. Yeah, I don&#146;t want to be
the reason you&#146;re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I <strong>really</strong>
don&#146;t want to be the reason I&#146;m unhappy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, she is coming in for the day carrying a picture for her
new office. Mrs. Lynch is coming out of Joanna&#146;s office, carrying a box.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Lynch:</b> Oh my goodness! You haven&#146;t heard!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Heard what?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Lynch:</b> Joanna passed away last night.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! How?!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Lynch:</b> Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Lynch:</b> I know!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Lynch:</b> I didn&#146;t realize that she was so close.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, <strong>so</strong> close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an
emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any
paperwork your way before&#133; it happened.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Lynch:</b> No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few
seconds later.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she&#146;d still be with us&#151;nothing
about an assistant buyer?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Lynch:</b> (starting to cry) No, I&#146;m sorry. I have to go. (She leaves as
Sophie arrives.)</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> (happily) Good morning!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn&#146;t hear about Joanna&#133;</p>

<p><b>Sophie:</b> I sure did! (smiles)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica&#146;s new kitchen, Allesandro is introducing her to her new employees.]</p>

<p><b>Allesandro:</b> I&#146;m so excited about having Monica come on board with us.
Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it&#146;s like losing a member of
the family. Of course, that <strong>literally</strong> is the case for several of you.
Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we&#146;re gonna miss him. Now, I
know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review.
So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b>&nbsp; Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a
pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the
recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe are there as Ross enters.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! </p>

<p><strong>Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe</strong>: Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sorry I&#146;m late, did I miss anything?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Joey stuffing 15 <em>Oreos</em> in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious
mouth full, nods yes.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an <em>Oreo</em> and
Joey mumbles, no!)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Where were you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum
upstate.</p>

<p>(simultaneously) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, which museum?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (just Phoebe) No, answer his.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the
door, so she&#146;d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my
mercy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Were you so late because you were burring this woman?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I&#146;m getting back down &#145;cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She
seems really great, but she&#146;s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours
away.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How can she be great if she&#146;s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they
all look at him) That joke would&#146;ve killed in Albany.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Done! I did it! Heh, who&#146;s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie
remains all over his teeth.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They&#146;re lighting the big
Christmas tree tonight.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, that paper&#146;s two weeks old. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really
wanted to take Kathy to this, I can&#146;t believe I missed it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, y&#146;know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I <strong>hate</strong>
being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it&#146;ll be Valentine&#146;s Day,
then my birthday, then bang!&#151;before you know it, they&#146;re lighting that damn tree
again. Ohh, I <strong>want</strong> somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in)
Y&#146;know, I want a <strong>man</strong>!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it
doesn&#146;t even have to be a big relationship, y&#146;know, just like a fling would be
great.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?! I didn&#146;t think girls ever just wanted a fling.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, believe me, it&#146;s been a long time since I&#146;ve been flung.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I know what I&#146;m giving you for Christmas.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know what? There&#146;s some nice guys at my office, do you
want me to set you up?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Wait a minute, it&#146;s been a long time that I&#146;ve been
single. How come you never offered this before?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I have a girlfriend, I&#146;m-I&#146;m happy. So, I no longer
feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don&#146;t like
guys with boring jobs.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?</p>

<p>(Monica enters)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What&#146;s wrong Mon?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I
get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef&#146;s
hat. (The hat says &#145;Quit, bitch&#146;)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, maybe they meant to write, &#145;Quiet, bitch.&#146;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, honey! What&#146;s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I
was just trying to be nice! Whoa!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they
had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and
Monica glares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohhh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean they&#146;re trying to do everything they can to make me quit,
and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I&#146;ve been waiting for
my whole life.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, wait a minute, you&#146;re the boss! Why don&#146;t you just yell
at them? Or, fire them?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I would love too, but I can&#146;t! I mean I just can&#146;t, you know
that I&#146;m not good at confrontation.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,
I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so
he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who&#146;s boss.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Mon! I&#146;m not doing anything, why don&#146;t you fire me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good enough to get fired.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, you&#146;re hired!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy
direct <em>Burger King</em> commercials?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (he glares at him for a while) Yes.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s office, he is trying to find Rachel a date.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him)
Og-ee-op, I&#146;m not asking for me, I&#146;m&#133; I mean&#133; No, I&#146;m-I&#146;m
not gay, I&#146;m not asking you out. I&#146;m not-I&#146;m not-I&#146;m not gay!</p>

<p><b>Drew:</b> I didn&#146;t think you were gay. I do now.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.</p>

<p><b>Drew:</b> Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I&#146;m not looking for any
thing serious.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, y&#146;know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a
fling, that might be all right with Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Mike:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas
party, Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.</p>

<p><b>Mike:</b> Oh wow! I&#146;m free for her!</p>

<p><b>Drew:</b> Oh, wait a second! I didn&#146;t say I wasn&#146;t free!</p>

<p><b>Mike:</b> Hey, Chandler, why don&#146;t we talk this over at the Ranger game
tomorrow?</p>

<p><b>Drew:</b> Hold on, y&#146;know I <strong>just</strong> got a box of Cubans, maybe I
bring them by your office around uh, five?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh well, that&#146;s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to
stay, but sure!</p>

<p><b>Mike:</b> Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch
Basel Hadens.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I don&#146;t really know what that is, but <strong>let&#146;s</strong>!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is working on a new song.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! You guys, I&#146;m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want
to hear it?</p>

<p><strong>Monica, Rachel, and Joey:</strong> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) <em>Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!</em></p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, that&#146;s great!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yay!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But y&#146;know umm, Rachel doesn&#146;t rhyme with draddle.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know but it&#146;s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.
Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a
nickname that&#146;s easier to rhyme?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Didn&#146;t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hello, children!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing
themselves at me! They&#146;re buying me drinks! They&#146;re giving me stuff! (to Joey)
Knicks tonight?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure! Where are the seats?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wherever! I&#146;ve got like 20!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, will I like any of these guys?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know what, I&#146;m gonna uh, play the field just a little
more.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Guys are signing over their 401-K&#146;s to me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (shocked) You work with robots!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there&#146;s this one guy, Patrick, I
think you&#146;re gonna like him, he&#146;s really nice, he&#146;s funny, he&#146;s a
swimmer.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, I like swimmer&#146;s bodies!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit
cards.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Op, I like credit cards!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> See, I&#146;m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, so what does he do?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Your company has a fine foods division?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s a big company, I don&#146;t&#151;if you&#151;I&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now, wait a second! You make food <strong>and</strong> robots?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! No, the robots just work for them.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (getting up) All right, I&#146;m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a
problem with that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You want a problem? I&#146;ll give you a problem!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, what are you gonna do? You&#146;re gonna fire me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You bet your ass, I&#146;m gonna fire you! Thank you. </p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross, Phoebe, and Chandler are there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah! With who?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can&#146;t decide
between the two of them. Y&#146;know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she&#146;s a
two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this
other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y&#146;know she&#146;s, well
she&#146;s-she&#146;s just as pretty, I guess she&#146;s smart, she&#146;s <strong>not</strong>
fun.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> If she&#146;s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y&#146;know? She lives so
close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that
was&#151;if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn&#146;t kidding,
she&#146;s not fun, she&#146;s stupid, and kind of a racist.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, man!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)</p>

<p>[Scene: Allesandro&#146;s, Monica is cooking.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering from the dining room) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, what happened to your fancy chef&#146;s jacket? (sees there&#146;s a
burn spot on it)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> They baked it. I can&#146;t take this anymore. I&#146;m gonna call a
meeting tonight, I&#146;m gonna fire you tonight.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens
to be over her breast.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s still a tiny bit on fire there.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thanks. (Joey&#146;s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is there.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, like father, like son.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this
could maybe turn into something serious.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?! I-I thought you weren&#146;t looking for something serious? I
thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn&#146;t tell him that, though?
Right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ummmmmmmm, no.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don&#146;t tell
the guy that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why not?! I&#146;d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just
looking to get&#151;oh I see.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting
out on the first date&#151;oh, he&#146;s so gonna get the wrong idea.</p>

<p>[Scene: Allesandro&#146;s, Joey is eating some cheese.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Listen uh, I&#146;d prefer it if you didn&#146;t call me Joey. Since
I don&#146;t know anyone here, I thought it&#146;d be cool to try out a cool work
nickname.</p>

<p><b>A Waiter:</b> (entering) Hey, dragon! Here&#146;s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
(hands him two envelopes)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (opening an envelope) There&#146;s like-there&#146;s like 300 bucks in
this one!</p>

<p><b>The Waiter:</b> Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never
hurts to wear tight trousers.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight&#146;s specials?
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag&#151;Why is
nobody writing these down?</p>

<p><b>The Waiter:</b> Because we can remember them.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like
you did the other night?</p>

<p><b>The Waiter:</b> Well, sure, that too.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here&#146;s the
thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive
atmosphere&#133;</p>

<p><b>The Waiter:</b> Can&#146;t hear you!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She
holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be <strong>my</strong>
way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at
the money he&#146;s holding, and doesn&#146;t speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No ma&#146;am.</p>

<p><b>The Waiter:</b> Hey! He has a name, it&#146;s Dragon. Do you wanna know your name?
Check your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Allesandro&#146;s, continued from earlier. The other waiters are gone and
Monica is confronting Joey about his not speaking up.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What the hell happened?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there
with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,
&quot;Wow! It&#146;s been a long time since I had&#133; (tries to do the math in his head,
but can&#146;t) 327 + 238 dollars!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, we had a deal. That-that&#146;s why you&#146;re here! I&#146;ve
got to fire you!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don&#146;t fire me,
instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they&#146;ll start listening to all the nice
things I&#146;ve been saying about you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What kinda things have you been saying?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is working on her holiday song, Chandler is sitting on the
couch reading a magazine, and Ross is sleeping on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting) Oh, y&#146;know, y&#146;know what Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m not Jewish, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So! Ross doesn&#146;t <strong>really</strong> decorate his tree with
floss, but you don&#146;t hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which
wakes up Ross with a start.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bad dream?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I wasn&#146;t sleeping.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe&#146;s song about?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The one with the cat. I gotta go, I&#146;ve got another date.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, did you pick one yet?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a
different joke than I thought&#151;it wasn&#146;t that funny. So I&#146;m still torn.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well look, you don&#146;t really like the one from uptown and
you&#146;re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end
them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your
way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you&#146;re
done!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&#146;know, you&#146;re right. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Prague?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> There&#146;s sooo much you don&#146;t know.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is playing living room golf as Rachel enters.
Rachel sees this and holds the door open until Chandler is ready to start his swing, when
he is, she slams the door shut which causes the club to fly from his hands. He turns
around, shocked.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not
tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I did! I absolutely did!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You idiot!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m sure you&#146;re right, but why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You don&#146;t tell a guy that you&#146;re looking for a serious
relationship! You don&#146;t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, man. I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m so-so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&#146;know, you should <strong>never</strong> be allowed to talk to
people!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know! I know!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! See just I&#146;m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being
alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y&#146;know, you&#146;re-you&#146;re gonna meet somebody!
You&#146;re a great catch! Y&#146;know when I was telling all those guys about you, I
didn&#146;t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, it doesn&#146;t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey,
y&#146;know what, I&#146;ve got two tickets to tonight&#146;s Rangers game, you wanna come
with me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, actually it&#146;s a hockey team, so it&#146;s angry Canadians
with no teeth.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Have you ever been with a woman?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So there is no good time to ask that question.</p>

<p>[Scene: A train to Poughkeepsie, Ross is asleep against the window.]</p>

<p><b>The Conductor:</b> The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!</p>

<p><strong>The Woman From Poughkeepsie:</strong> (outside Ross&#146;s window) Ross? Ross!
(she knocks on the window) Wake up! Ross! (the train starts moving) Ross! Ross!! Ross!!!
Ross!!!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Allesandro&#146;s, Monica is cooking.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me
some more swordfish?</p>

<p><b>Kitchen Worker:</b> I don&#146;t speak English.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You did a minute ago!</p>

<p><b>Kitchen Worker:</b> Well, I don&#146;t know what to tell ya!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Fine!</p>

<p>(She goes into the freezer to get it herself, and leaves the door open. The waiter from
earlier comes by and closes the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I&#146;m cold!
(She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door
opens)</p>

<p><b>The Waiter:</b> You found that handle, did ya?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s not funny.</p>

<p><b>The Waiter:</b> Well that&#146;s not true.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (starting to cry) I&#146;m a good person. And I&#146;m a good chef, and
I don&#146;t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y&#146;know what, if you want me
to quit this bad, then all you have to do is&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y&#146;know that little speech you made
the other day? Well I got a problem with it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You bet I do! I just ah, wasn&#146;t listening then, that&#146;s all.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well if you want a problem? I&#146;ll give you a problem!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you gonna do? You&#146;re gonna fire me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You bet your ass I&#146;m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get
out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How &#145;bout you Chuckles?
You think this is funny now?</p>

<p><b>The Waiter:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How about if I <strong>dance around</strong> all covered in sauce? Huh?
You think it&#146;s funny now? </p>

<p><b>The Waiter:</b> No, it&#146;s really good.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from
earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!</p>

<p>[Scene: The train, it&#146;s pulling into a station.]</p>

<p><b>The Conductor:</b> Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting
next to him)</p>

<p><b>Woman On Train:</b> I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that
I see them, I win.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Woman On Train:</b> We&#146;re at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!</p>

<p><b>Woman On Train:</b> Yes we are. So, coffee?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?</p>

<p><b>Woman On Train:</b> Oh, no. But it&#146;s just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
</p>

<p>[Scene: Allesandro&#146;s, Joey is coming back in with his coat on.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well I guess I should&#146;ve thought about my wife and kids before I
talked back to chef Geller!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yep! Looks like it&#146;s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon
house this year.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Enough!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Frank and Alice are there talking with Phoebe.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! I can&#146;t believe my little brother is married!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh I know!! (Both he and Alice squeal hysterically)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys, why didn&#146;t you tell me you were eloping?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> &#145;Cause it just sorta happened, y&#146;know we were at the
courthouse, we were having lunch&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse? </p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like,
&quot;Hey! Y'know, we&#146;re here, having lunch let&#146;s get married!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, a year and a half ago I didn&#146;t even know I had a brother, and
now I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay.
Stop it, don&#146;t. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Uhh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> We&#146;ve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got
engaged, we thought we&#146;d get a jump on things, y&#146;know no one&#146;s getting any
younger.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> See the thing is umm, we&#146;re not able to y&#146;know, uh, conceive.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> And we&#146;ve tried everything, we&#146;ve seen a bunch of doctors.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby
is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into
another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (shocked) That&#146;s a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy
boat.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are trying to throw cards
into a vase.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (He&#146;s
wearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.</p>

<p>(The gang is stunned.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you-you know what I meant.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, you messed it up. You&#146;re stupid.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So what job did you get Joe?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, how can you be a tour guide, don&#146;t you have to be a dinosaur
expert or something?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, not really. They give you all the information, it&#146;s uh, it&#146;s
like memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) &quot;And on your left, you have
Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler, Monica, and Rachel:</strong>&nbsp; Great!! That&#146;s great!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh actually Joey, it&#146;s the Cretasous period.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh my God!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And! And, they&#146;re gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And!
And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You&#146;re really thinking about having sex with your brother?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ewww! And &quot;Oh no!&quot; It&#146;s&#151;they just want me to be the
surrogate. It&#146;s her-it&#146;s her egg and her sperm, and I&#146;m-I&#146;m just the
oven, it&#146;s totally their bun. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What did you tell them?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to
think about? I&#146;m gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&#146;re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a <em>Sony Play
Station</em>?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are
things to think about.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, like you&#146;re gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, you&#146;re talking about putting your body through an awful lot,
I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it&#146;s all for somebody else!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, what&#146;s your point?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, the stuff I just mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! I don&#146;t know if I could ever do that. I always figured the
first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a&#133;keeper.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim
furniture.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we&#146;ll be supportive
like crazy.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We just want you to think it through.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who&#146;s had a baby. Like
your mom?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are kissing.]</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Umm, (moves her hand&#146;s down to his butt) I love this touchy. Can I
take it to work with me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah, sure, it&#146;s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh! (They kiss and she leaves)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I am so jealous.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You guys are really right&#133;there aren&#146;t you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. Right where?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> In the beginning where y&#146;know it&#146;s all sex and talking and sex
and talking and&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And the sex?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, we haven&#146;t had sex yet. Okay, what&#146;s the big
deal? Y&#146;know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the
next level.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Chandler that is so nice.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That is really nice&#133;lying! No way is that the reason!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why? Just because you&#146;re not mature enough to understand something
like that?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, he&#146;s right, I&#146;m totally lying.</p>

<p>(Ross makes an &quot;I was right, and you weren&#146;t face.&quot; And Rachel does
Ross&#146;s little I&#146;m-flicking-you-off-but-I&#146;m-not-giving-you-the-finger
banging of the fists.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Then what is it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, Kathy&#146;s last boyfriend was Joey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And you&#146;re afraid you won&#146;t be able to&#133;fill his shoes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I&#146;m afraid I won&#146;t be able to make love as well as him.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, and I was saying the actual words.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So big deal, so Joey&#146;s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn&#146;t
mean he&#146;s great in bed.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We share a wall! So either he&#146;s great in bed, or she just likes
to agree with him a lot.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sweetie, with you it&#146;s gonna be different. The sex is gonna be
great, &#145;cause you-you guys are in love.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just go for it Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, you should.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, you should, really.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Go on.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, all right, I&#146;ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But
I&#146;m just doing it for you guys.</p>

<p>[Scene: The museum, Joey is giving a tour to a bunch of school kids.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.</p>

<p><b>Smart Kid:</b> Isn&#146;t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a
fossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display
cases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave
&#145;Hi&#146; to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at
work. (Ross does the old &quot;Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your
mouth trick.&quot;) Okay, moving right along. Come on.</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe Sr.&#146;s house, there&#146;s a knock on the door.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> It&#146;s open! Come in!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m late.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Oh, that&#146;s okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! You really go all out when you&#146;re expecting company.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> No, I was working on my pottery.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn&#146;t know that you did&#133;pot.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and
erotica.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, erotiery!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just
thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.
Y&#146;know&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> I really don&#146;t think it&#146;s a very good idea, Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Well, because you&#146;d be giving up a baby, and I-I really
don&#146;t&#151;I don&#146;t know if there&#146;s anything I can say that could make you
understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to the
couch.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don&#146;t-don&#146;t hurt the
puppy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> No-no-no, the-the puppy&#146;s yours.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I get a puppy!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> I realise I don&#146;t have any right to start get all parenty on you
and everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isn&#146;t paying attention and is busy
mimicking the puppy.) uhh&#133; Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy,
it&#146;s very important. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> I mean, I know what I&#146;m talking about. I gave up two babies, and
I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible
it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every
single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it
would be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppy
again, and not listening) I really shouldn&#146;t have given you the puppy first.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p>[Scene: The museum&#146;s worker cafeteria, Joey is eating lunch with the rest of the
tour guides. Another tour guide tries to sit down in a seat Joey saved for Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I&#146;m-I&#146;m saving this for my
friend Ross.</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b> You mean Dr. Geller?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Doctor? Wow! I didn&#146;t know he had a nickname.</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b> Oh, he won&#146;t sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit
over there, (Points to there table) and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, how-how come?</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b> That&#146;s just the way it is.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s crazy.</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b> Maybe it&#146;s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats
and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in
the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but
now&#133;(Turns around) Peter! Hey, Peter! It&#146;s me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my
puddin&#146; which you man! I gave you my <em>Snack Pack</em>! (to Joey) See, he pretend
he don&#146;t even here me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I-I think everybody&#146;s pretending they don&#146;t hear you. Anyway,
look, I don&#146;t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is
one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I&#146;m telling you, he <b>will</b> sit
in it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I
saved you seat.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s okay, I&#146;m cool over here. I&#146;ll catch up with you
later, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)</p>

<p>(Another woman enters without a coat or blazer and tries to sit at the &#145;blue&#146;
table.)</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b> Op, this is saved. (Joey wonders why) Gift shop.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is eating dinner, Monica and Rachel are sitting on
the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey, uh, I&#146;m really, really sorry about what happened in
the cafeteria today.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s no big deal. Hey, y&#146;know, you do what you gotta do. Right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But hey, it&#146;s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides <b>never</b>
sit together.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whatever.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where
you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other
chefs, right?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, Ross, really it&#146;s-it&#146;s no big deal. Y&#146;know you wear a
white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can&#146;t be friends at work, then so
be it. Y&#146;know, hey I understand. Y&#146;know? Hey, when I&#146;m in a play and
you&#146;re in the audience, I don&#146;t talk to you, right? So it&#146;s y&#146;know,
it&#146;s uh, it&#146;s cool. I&#146;ll see you tomorrow. (Leaves)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, when we&#146;re in the audience he doesn&#146;t talk to us, but he
does wave.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe is there with her puppy and is
trying to sing it to sleep as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, y&#146;know what, I think it&#146;s time for puppy to go out again.
Come on, let&#146;s go to the balcony.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, the street. Come on, let&#146;s go to the street. Ooh, listen,
don&#146;t go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Chandler) So, did you do it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, yes, we had the sex.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh-oh, it was bad?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It was fine, y&#146;know? But she didn&#146;t agree with me as
strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, &quot;I see you point, I&#146;m all
right with it.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, it was the first time. Y&#146;know, there&#146;s not always a lot
of agreement the first time.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a
woman, y&#146;know, I know where everything goes, it&#146;s always nice. But I need to
know what makes it go from nice to, &quot;My God! Somebody&#146;s killing her in
there!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, I&#146;m gonna show you something a lot of guys don&#146;t
know. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All
right. Now&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, you don&#146;t have to draw an actual wo&#151;whoa! She&#146;s
hot!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling
them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there&#146;s more than
three), five, six, and seven!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (shocked) There are seven?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (Points to one) That&#146;s one?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s kind of an important one!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, y&#146;know-y&#146;know what, I was looking at it upside down.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y&#146;know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that
could&#146;ve meant.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set
up camp.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That-that&#146;s bad?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well if you go to <em>Disneyland</em>, you don&#146;t spend the whole
day on the Materhorn.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well you might if it were anything like 7!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit
&#145;em all, and you mix &#145;em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,
5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,
6-7, 7, &#133;7..&#133;7&#133;7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7&#133;(mouths 7)! (They both lean
back on the couch satisfied.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The museum cafeteria, Joey is eating with the tour guides as Ross enters.]</p>

<p><b><b>Older Scientist:</b></b> Dr. Geller, there&#146;s a seat over here. (Motions to
an empty chair at the &#145;white&#146; table.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I&#146;m having my lunch at this table, here
in the middle. I&#146;m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he&#146;ll
sit with me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table
and they shake hands.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something
unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y&#146;know
what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in
blue blazers, and I ask myself, &quot;My God why?!&quot; Now, I say we shed these-these
coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat
and throws it down.) I&#146;m Ross! I&#146;m divorced, and I have a kid!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) I&#146;m Joey! I&#146;m an
actor! I don&#146;t know squat about dinosaurs!</p>

<p><b>Another Tour Guide:</b> (standing up and removing his coat) I&#146;m Ted, and I just
moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, there you go!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!</p>

<p><b><b>Older Scientist:</b></b> I&#146;m Andrew, and I didn&#146;t pay for this pear.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, good-good for you.</p>

<p><b>Tour Guide:</b> I&#146;m Rhonda, (motions to her breasts) and these aren&#146;t
real! (Joey and Ross look at each other, shocked)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow, Rhonda.</p>

<p><b>Another Scientist:</b> I&#146;m Scott.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, okay, Scott!</p>

<p><b>Another Scientist:</b> And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times
before I leave a room or my family will die.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, with the puppy, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the
couch.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> My mom&#146;s gonna be here any minute. I can&#146;t do this, I
can&#146;t give him up. Yes&#151;no, I can. I don&#146;t want to. But I can. No.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oo, I can&#146;t watch this, it&#146;s like <em>Sophie&#146;s Choice</em>.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know, I never saw that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, it was only okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, I can&#146;t do this. My mom was right. If I can&#146;t-if I
can&#146;t give him up, then there&#146;s no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and
Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give &#145;em&#151;a
kidney!</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> (entering with Frank) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah, so we just thought we&#146;d stop by and let you know there&#146;s
still no pressure.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we&#146;re just
gonna be right over there (points to the counter) having coffee.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> (noticing the puppy) Oh, who&#146;s this little guy?! (Grabs the puppy)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Ooh! Umm!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh, he&#146;s so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> You are so precious, I could just take you home.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, why don&#146;t you?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh, thanks.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I&#146;m really okay with this. Y&#146;know why? &#145;Cause look at
them, and I made that, so&#133; I know it&#146;s gonna be like a million times harder to
give up a baby but, oh my God, it&#146;s gonna feel like a million times better, right? I
wanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> (shocked) Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don&#146;t know what this
means to us! Oh!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh my God, I think I&#146;m gonna cry!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s gonna be so great.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> (entering) Hi! What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided
I&#146;m gonna carry their baby.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> But Phoebe&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is
a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe Sr:</b> Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it&#146;s just&#151;that was my
puppy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, it&#146;s 0-Dark:30, in other words it&#146;s really,
really early. Everyone&#146;s asleep, and all through the apartments not a creature was
stirring, not even a mouse. That is except for the chick, who turns out to be a rooster
and is crowing in the sun. Needless to say, this awakens Monica and Rachel who rush into
their living room, searching for the cause of the sound.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What the <b>hell</b> is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is
that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.)
Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey&#146;s with Monica in trail.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Boy, you are <b>really</b> not a morning person.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get
up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!</p>

<p>(Chandler opens the door, finally.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> <b>What</b> is that noise?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s the chick! She&#146;s&#133;going through some changes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What kind of changes?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well the vet seems to think that&#146;s she&#146;s becoming a rooster.
(The rooster crows.) We&#146;re getting a second opinion.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, it&#146;s later that morning, everybody has gotten up and
Ross and Phoebe has joined them for breakfast. Rachel is returning from shopping.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I&#146;ve been up since six. Thanks to <b>somebody&#146;s</b>
dumb-ass rooster.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn&#146;t
be living in an apartment.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. I&#146;m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if
I&#146;m ready to have Frank and Alice&#146;s embryo transferred into my uterus.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Now, how will they know if you&#146;re ready?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, they&#146;re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is
thick.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay everyone, think thick.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Good-bye! Good luck! (She opens the door to reveal Monica and Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi! Wish me luck!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, good luck.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good luck. (to Monica) And I&#146;m still right!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That is sooo not true!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She&#146;s mad because I know today&#146;s her laundry day and that means
she&#146;s wearing her old lady underpants.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can check that for ya.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I just&#151;I can&#146;t believe that you think that you and Chandler
know me and Rachel better than we know you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well&#133; we-we do. <b>You</b> can only eat Tic Tacks in even
numbers.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, what&#146;s that about?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Rachel) And you&#133; Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel&#146;s
bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) You&#146;re good.
(Tries a cookie.) These are not.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m <b>so</b> not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Five.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How many guesses do you get?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Six.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Challenge extended.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Deal!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Challenge excepted.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, we&#146;ll start with&#133;apples.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We&#146;ll be starting with apples.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) Stop that now!</p>

<p>(Ross reveals a bag of apples.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Diet soda.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes. Yes. Yes. (They&#146;re perfect so far.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Orange juice.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! There&#146;s no orange juice in there! We win!! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ha-ha!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> They <b>have</b> another guess.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, well, we won that one.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, the last thing&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joey&#146;s ear.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, not for like another two weeks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I got it! Scotch&#133; tape. (They&#146;re right.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How did you know she would buy scotch tape?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, we used there&#146;s up last night making scary faces.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aww, man!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme
it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal
questions.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Serious?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you scared?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross will do it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh sure, &quot;Ross will do it!&quot; It&#146;s not like he has a job, or
a child, or a life of his own.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Fine! We&#146;ll ask Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no-no, I-I wanna play.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Doctor&#146;s office, Dr. Zane is examining Phoebe as Frank and Alice
watch.]</p>

<p><b>Dr. Zane:</b> It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Well, okay, so what&#146;s now&#151;go get, go get the eggs, put &#145;em
in there.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Zane:</b> Okay, it&#146;ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Embryossss? As in, &quot;More than one?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Dr. Zane:</b> Um-hmm, five actually.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the
stairs?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Zane:</b> We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will
attach.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s it! 25 percent? That means that&#146;s it&#146;s like 75
percent chance of no baby at all!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Hey, y&#146;know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you
stuff like 200 of them in there?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Unfortunately that is correct.</p>

<p><b>The Girls:</b> Yes!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He
opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Ohhhh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You guys are dead, I am <b>so</b> good at lighting rounds.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we&#146;re gonna destroy
you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Huh, wanna bet?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&#146;m so confused as to what we&#146;ve been doing so
far&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How about we play for more money, say 150?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 150 dollars.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Say 200?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 200 dollars.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You&#146;re doing it again.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, I don&#146;t want to lose 200 dollars.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We won&#146;t. (to Chandler) 300?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m just trying to spice it up!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, so let&#146;s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oooohh that&#146;s interesting.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, no way, that rooster&#146;s family!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Throw in the duck too!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What do you have against the duck?! He doesn&#146;t make any noise!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, he gets the other one all riled up.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, we are not gonna&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But if we win, we get your apartment.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oooooh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Deal!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, only slightly later.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, betting the apartment, I don&#146;t know about this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game!
Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why? Do you have the answers written on there?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, let&#146;s do it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (They go into the living room.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, gentlemen, you&#146;re up first.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (Starts jumping around.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins&#151;stop it (Chandler
stops jumping)&#151;now. What was Monica&#146;s nickname when she was a field hockey
goalie?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Big fat goalie.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Correct. Rachel claims <b>this</b> is her favorite movie&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <em>Dangerous Liaisons</em>.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> <em>Weekend at Bernie&#146;s</em>.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh! (Whispers something in Joey&#146;s ear and then in Ross&#146;s
ear.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many
categories are there?</p>

<p>(They both confer.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Everyday use.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fancy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Guest.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fancy guest.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Two seconds&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, 11!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 11, unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) All right,
that&#146;s 4 for the guys. Ladies, you&#146;re up. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on!</p>

<p>(As they change places, they give each other the now patented Ross maneuver. If you
don&#146;t know what that means, click here to find out The One With Joey's New

<p><b>Ross:</b> 30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round
begins&#133;now! What is Joey&#146;s favorite food?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sandwiches! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl&#146;s breast?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> 14?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And processing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> He carries a briefcase.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s umm, it has something to do with transponding.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh-oh, he&#146;s a transponce&#151;transpondster!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!</p>

<p>(Ross stops the clock, signifying the end of the lightning round.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> <b>NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!</p>
</b>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> <b>YEAH!!!</b> YES!!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are carrying
in the foosball table.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I call Monica&#146;s room!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can&#146;t just call Monica&#146;s room.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I&#146;m sight of the room and I
called it.</p>

<p>(Chandler grunts and turns around, sees that he&#146;s in sight of the room, and mouths
damn!)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Man, I feel like I&#146;m coming down with something.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can&#146;t guess what color my tonsils
are? I&#146;ll bet the apartment!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It&#146;s too nice.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey&#151;ooh Pheebs, are they in there?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they&#146;re implanted.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How do you feel?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, freaked. &#145;Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky.
And! This is Frank and Alice&#146;s like only shot. Like, they are <b>literally</b>
putting all of their eggs in my basket.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, but I bet it works.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?! How much?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I&#146;m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh wow! You can tell this soon.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body&#146;s always
been a little faster than Western medicine. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from Chandler&#146;s bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball
table.) Oh my God! I can&#146;t believe you guys are actually think you&#146;re moving in
here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well believe it baby!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well I-I-I&#146;m not moving.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> <b>What?!</p>
</b>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You can&#146;t just ignore the bet! It&#146;s a bet! You bet and you bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would&#146;ve
made them get rid of the birds. Right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noooo.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel
better, it&#146;s all your fault.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I knew it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t care, I&#146;m not going anywhere.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Cool, girl roommate.</p>

<p>(Phoebe comes in from the bathroom as Rachel sits down in disgust.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nope, not knocked up yet.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I&#146;m gonna do whatever I can to help
this so, I&#146;m just gonna y&#146;know, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair
and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I&#146;m let gravity
y&#146;know, do its jobs.</p>

<p>[Cut too later, the moving process is progressing steadily. Monica is trying to lift a
heavy box, as Rachel comes in from Chandler&#146;s bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment
and I like it! This is a girl&#146;s apartment! That is a boy&#146;s apartment, it&#146;s
dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It&#146;s-it&#146;s so pretty! And look, and
it&#146;s-it&#146;s purple! And I&#146;m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not
moving, and now <b>I</b> have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is
shaking uncontrollably.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;ll take care of it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s right! You do what the hand says!</p>

<p>[Cut to later, Phoebe is still in the chair and Rachel is laying down as Monica
enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How did it go?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I lost our mattresses.</p>

<p>[Cut to still later, Rachel has now resigned herself to move and is now helping Monica.
Phoebe is still on the chair.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) &quot;<em>Are you in there little fetus</em>? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>In nine will you come great us</em>? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>I will buy you some Adidas</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on the door and Monica answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Frank and Alice:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little
present.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Oh.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Umm, it&#146;s a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, don&#146;t mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> So umm, you feel like taking a test? There&#146;s only one question.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y&#146;know just remember that
it&#146;s still really early, okay so, if it says that I&#146;m not pregnant, that
doesn&#146;t mean that I&#146;m not gonna <b>get</b> pregnant, okay and, and just please,
just so I don&#146;t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Okay. (They both squeal in expectation.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Great. (Goes to take the test.)</p>

<p>(The door opens and Joey and Chandler ride in on the big, fake dog in triumph)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&#146;know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, don&#146;t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That is not true. She did! She forced me!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, we would still be living here if hadn&#146;t gotten the question
wrong!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well it stupid, unfair question!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Don&#146;t blame the questions!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving
day for us!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Will you stop calling it your apartment!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But it is our apartment!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No it&#146;s not!</p>

<p>(They all decay into massive bickering as Phoebe returns from the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys! You guys! You&#146;re gonna have a baby! They&#146;re gonna
have a baby!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> <b>MY SISTER&#146;S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!</p>
</b>

<p>(They all go over and hug Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, but this can&#146;t be good for the baby.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh! (They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her.)</p>

unpacking.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&#146;t find garbage bags!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I think I saw some in here. </p>

<p>(She opens a door and they both scream at horror at what&#146;s inside of it.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is it?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it&#146;ll

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!</p>

<p><b>Kathy's Co-Star:</b> Sooo, you&#146;ve been doing this long?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, you&#146;re my first. Put the money on the table.</p>

harder.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Dude!</p>

<p><b>Kathy's Co-Star:</b> Is that an expensive blouse?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> If you want it to be. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it&#146;s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.</p>

<p>(Joey climbs up on the counter and starts looking at the top of the cabinets.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I think I left a donut up here.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are entering after the play. Phoebe and Joey
are already there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! How was Kathy&#146;s play?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good
lookin&#146; guy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it&#146;s like someone <b>literally</b> wrote down my worst
nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <b>That&#146;s</b> a good idea for a business!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on
stage every night, and then they&#146;re gonna go to their cast parties and he&#146;s
gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it&#146;ll be like, &quot;So where&#146;s your
boyfriend, what&#146;s-his-name, Chester?&quot; And she&#146;ll go, &quot;No-no-no,
it&#146;s Chandler.&quot; And he&#146;ll go, &quot;Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, look they&#146;re actors. They&#146;re there to do a job, just
&#145;cause they work together, doesn&#146;t mean they&#146;re gonna get together. I mean
just &#145;cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn&#146;t mean
it&#146;s gonna happen with them.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> They&#146;re not a couple!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh-okay, I get the game now.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on
stage, was it like really hot?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well okay, so then you&#146;re fine. The rule is when two actors are
actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long
as it&#146;s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It&#146;s when the heat goes
away, that&#146;s when you&#146;re in trouble.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, you guys have been to every play I&#146;ve ever been in, have I ever
had chemistry on stage?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Noooo!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, the gang minus Monica and Rachel
are eating breakfast. Ross and Chandler are sitting at the foosball table and eating.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&#146;know what, I don&#146;t know how comfortable I am going to see how
hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know but&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no-no-no, I&#146;m there.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You made pancakes?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yep! Grab a plate.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her
pancakes.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which
flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin&#146; closer.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay, but don&#146;t worry, because we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles, <b>and</b>, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I&#146;m fairly certain
are the same thing.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen also we&#146;re uh, we&#146;re watching the game here Saturday
night, if people want to come over.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, who&#146;s playing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The players.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) Please, it&#146;s a relief is what it is, is what it is.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her
plate.)</p>

<p>[Scene: <em>Bloomingdale&#146;s</em>, Rachel&#146;s new job.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on the phone) Monica, I&#146;m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old
woman put on a thong and she didn&#146;t even buy it! (Pause) I&#146;m telling you
I&#146;m quitting! That&#146;s it! I&#146;m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I
am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you
get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah
really need to talk to you.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> In a moment, please, I&#146;m in the middle of a task. And you have
a customer. </p>

<p>(It&#146;s a really good-looking man, Joshua, that Rachel has an instant crush on. Well
actually it&#146;s Tate Donovan, so it&#146;s not like she&#146;s really testing her
acting skills.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Hi, I&#146;m Joshua.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, I&#146;m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my <b>ex</b>-wife&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p>(He walks over to look and some clothes and Rachel quickly turns around and adjusts her
bra, trying to show off her assets.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This
suit and what turned out to be a skirt.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, at least that&#146;s a great suit.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, but it wasn&#146;t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in
the skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if you&#146;re
willing, I&#146;m all yours.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Rachel, you needed to speak to me?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no, that wasn&#146;t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let
me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.</p>

<p>(He walks out and Rachel stares at his butt as he leaves. He makes a wrong turn.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh, sorry, it&#146;s this way, it&#146;s this way. (Motions to the
correct way.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> It&#146;s this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his
butt.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Kathy&#146;s play, Ross and Chandler are waiting for her in the lobby after the
play.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.
Before they had heat, and now there&#146;s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey
told us what this means!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, let&#146;s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was
some sexual chemistry between them.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Here she comes. Don&#146;t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don&#146;t
be&#133;y'know you.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Hey you guys!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it
tonight?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Wasn&#146;t Nick funny when he couldn&#146;t get his match lit?</p>

<p>(Chandler laughs without opening his mouth.)</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> It&#146;s a good play, isn&#146;t it?</p>

<p>(Chandler mumbles something, and Ross tells him to &quot;Come on.&quot;)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and <b>Nick</b> ditto. Clearly
you&#146;re having sex with him.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I&#133; (Walks away.)</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Clearly, I&#146;m having sex with him?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Okay, so let me just get this straight. You&#146;re accusing me of
cheating on you, and insulting my performance?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you&#146;re
up there every night, you&#146;re naked, touching, kissing.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I&#146;m-I&#146;m playing a part in a
play! How can you not trust me?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you can understand, given how we started.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh, wow. I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re throwing that in my face.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that is what happened, and I don&#146;t even see you denying
this!</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> I&#146;ll tell you what, Chandler, why don&#146;t you call me when you
grow up!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, don&#146;t expect <b>that</b> to happen anytime soon!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Phoebe, and Ross are there
eating pizza as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over
today, and I got to dress him up all day!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rachel has a new doll.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them
together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised
it, Joshua! Josh-<strong>u</strong>-a! Joshua! Josh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, hello!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi-e!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, what do I smell?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know, it smells good.</p>

<p>(He goes over and opens the door to reveal Monica holding a plate of cookies and a fan
to blow the smell across the hall.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Please, have some!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yumm!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I&#146;ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious
treats for everyone.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new <em>Playboy</em>!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, it&#146;s just something I picked up.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Cookies and porn, you&#146;re the best mom ever!!</p>

<p>(Rachel laughs hysterically for no reason.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What? What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be
there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&#146;s Joshua.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his
apartment. Joey follows him)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait! Wait! This isn&#146;t take-out!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, wait, please don&#146;t go! I&#146;ve got porn for you too!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I don&#146;t need it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> People are supposed to wanna hang out here!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why? Honey, what is the big deal?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m the hostess! Not those guys! I&#146;m always the hostess! I
mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought
their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone
has to hang out in the big apartment?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> &#145;Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But
I&#146;m-I&#146;m done now. They&#146;ve suffered enough.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> If you wanted to punish them, you should&#146;ve just made them hang out
here! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, that&#146;s true.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right then, when I&#146;m done with this place, it&#146;s gonna be
ten times better than that place!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, are we gonna trash that place?</p>

<p>(Chandler comes back, obviously drunk, and trips over the steps.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at
the new <em>Playboy</em>) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the <em>Playboy </em>behind
their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl&#146;s apartment.) You will all be very happy
to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So you were right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I confronted her, and she didn&#146;t deny it! (Pause) I don&#146;t
live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler, what did she say?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait a minute.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come here.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to <em>Beefsteak

<p><b>Rachel:</b> <em>Beefsteak Charlie&#146;s</em>?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! See you and I have always been like&#151;(motions that they think
the same.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, Monica is lugging one of those floor
polishing machines through the hallway. Rachel comes up the steps and stops when she sees
Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey&#146;s.) Oh, hey, do you
need help with that?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nah, I got it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and
Joey&#146;s.)</p>

<p>[Cut to inside the apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
It&#146;s just so frustrating!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why don&#146;t you ask him out?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, totally! That&#146;s such a turn-on!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really? It doesn&#146;t seem desperate?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-ooh, that&#146;s the turn-on.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He just got a divorce right? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hmm-mmm.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So he&#146;s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you
just have to make the first move.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah but, I&#146;ve never asked a guy out before.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (shocked) You&#146;ve never asked a guy out?!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Have you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thousands of times!! That doesn&#146;t make me sound too good does it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t even know how I would go about it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,
&quot;Hey, how you doin&#146;?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, please!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin&#146;?</p>

<p>(Phoebe looks at him, and then giggles and looks away.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You know what, I&#146;m gonna do that, I&#146;m gonna call him up, and
I&#146;m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin&#146;?
(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It&#146;s Rachel Green from <em>Bloomingdale&#146;s</em>.
(Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store
today? Well, we found <b>a</b> wallet, and we&#151;(Listens) the license? Well, that is a
good idea! Uh, well, let&#146;s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh,
belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I&#146;ll
see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You&#146;ve done that a thousand times?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;ve never done that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you gotta give him something that he can&#146;t say no too. Like uh,
Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you&#146;re guaranteed he&#146;ll say
yes!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?! You think that will work?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Absolutely! And if it doesn&#146;t, can I get the extra ticket?</p>

<p>(We hear a noise coming from Monica and Rachel&#146;s apartment.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What the heck is that?</p>

<p>(They go open the door and reveal Monica being spun around on the floor polisher and
getting the cord wrapped around her legs.)</p>

watching a movie as Chandler comes in from his bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Did she call?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, maybe I should call her.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! Forget her, man! You don&#146;t need her, you don&#146;t need that!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He&#146;s right, what she did was unforgivable.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How might you be wrong?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well y'know, what if she didn&#146;t actually sleep with the guy?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, tell me she actually told you this.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.
Back me up here, Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s all you&#146;re basing this on?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and
the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There&#146;s a lot of theories
that didn&#146;t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!!</p>

<p>[Scene: <em>Bloomingdale&#146;s</em>, Rachel&#146;s new job, she is waiting for Joshua
and practising how to ask him out.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You
know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too&#133; (Tries again.)
Umm, who likes the Knicks&#151;(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the
mirror.) Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how
they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like
it?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I&#146;m gonna wear it home.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> All right, thank you so much for all your help. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah-eah-ha!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe I&#146;ll see in the spring, with the
uh, y&#146;know, for the uh, bathing suits.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh well, you don&#146;t want to do that now?!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Ah, that&#146;s okay, thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Anyway, hopefully, I&#146;ll see you around sometime. (He goes out the
door.)</p>

interested, just as a thank you for this week.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Wow! That would be great.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks!
This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr.
Waltham returns.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Good morning.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I&#146;m sorry.
Y&#146;know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely
understand why you were so upset.</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh wow. I really wish you&#146;d call me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y&#146;know I-I think this is a
good thing. Y'know? &#145;Cause we&#146;ve had our first fight, and now we can move on.
Y&#146;know, I know for me&#151;(Notices a pair of men&#146;s pants on the chair.)
Nick&#146;s pants?</p>

<p><b>Kathy:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a <b>big</b> one!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an
extra ticket.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> He didn&#146;t turn me down! He&#146;s at the game isn&#146;t he? I got
the date, I&#146;m just not on it!</p>

you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with
his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I <b>hate</b> her! Well, I
don&#146;t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How? How is your fault?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because, I-I should&#146;ve called! Y&#146;know if I had just called
her after our big, stupid fight, she never would&#146;ve gone out with Nick, and they
would&#146;ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it
does not justify her sleeping with someone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, if-if she thought they were on a break&#133;</p>

<p>(They all turn and glare at him.)</p>

comes in.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A
Joshua Bergen. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Will you call him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and
holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in <em>Spaceballs</em>,
and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my
wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I&#146;m glad.
Rachel, I&#146;d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin&#146;?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is getting ready for a
fishing trip and Phoebe is asking him about the fishing lures. Ross is playing with the
rod, and Monica is pretty much just watching the on goings.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Guggly worm.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Glow-pop giggly jammer.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (laughs harder) You make it so funny.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what&#146;s
this?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the
sandwich)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller&#146;s got one hooked!
Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It&#146;s the
classic struggle between man and&#151;(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone
knocked over a lamp.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (going over and picking up the rod) That&#146;s all right. Hey you guys,
you know what&#146;s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets
me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, &quot;Joey, what are you doing with
your life?&quot; stuff. I can say, &quot;Well, I&#146;m doing a movie with Charlton Heston
dad. What are you doing with your life?&quot;</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Great!</p>

<p>(Chandler enters from his bedroom, all depressed and wearing sweat pants, with the
chick and duck in tow.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You don&#146;t have to stop having fun just because I&#146;m here.
Kathy didn&#146;t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler
goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Joey, I don&#146;t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I
mean it&#146;s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing
next week?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, there&#146;s nothing I can do for him right now, he&#146;s still in
his sweat pants, that&#146;s still Phase One. Y'know? I&#146;ll be back for Phase Two, I
would never miss Phase Two.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What&#146;s Phase Two?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Gettin&#146; drunk and going to a strip club. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How does going to a strip club help him better?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Because there are naked ladies there.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There are naked ladies there too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would
you give me one minute!! Please.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Bloomingdale&#146;s, Rachel is still dressing Joshua. He is trying on a pair of
pants.]</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at
his ass.) There we go. There it is.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> (turning around) Oh! You know what I need? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay. Uhh, well let&#146;s see. (Grabs his hand.) You&#146;re
about&#151;well uh, this one is large. And this one&#151;(Grabs the other hand.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Also large?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> (entering) Rachel! Could I have a moment?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London&#151;well
Shropshire really but y&#146;know&#151;well she&#146;s about your age I say. Anyway I have
tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you&#146;d like to keep her
company this evening?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure. You got it. Great! </p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Me, Fledermaus, great. I really&#151;(motions to Joshua.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> So&#133;(Holds out his hands as to say, &quot;Where are my
gloves?&quot;)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and
hoping for something more intimate.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Gloves?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I&#146;ll be right back!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Uhh, actually y&#146;know what, I kinda&#151;I have to take off. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Nothing!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> I invested in this night-club and it&#146;s opening tonight, would you
like to come?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! That would be great!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> You&#146;re into hardcore S&amp;M right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (shocked) Well, I-I guess&#151;I&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Kidding! (Rachel is relived) I&#146;m gonna get there early, but
I&#146;m going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, great, you betcha!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> (entering) I almost forget the tickets, didn&#146;t I?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Oh, right.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> I think you&#146;ll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yay!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is in his sweats
flinging playing cards into a pot.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know, I can&#146;t believe Kathy did this too me. I really,
thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I&#146;m never getting out of
this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the
one? My sweat pants!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take &#145;em off
and we&#146;ll have some fun.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey-hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God, you guys have no idea. </p>

<p><b>All:</b> (they all recoil from the smell emanating from him) Oh! God! Wow!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You stink!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you kidding?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big
tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how&#146;s he doing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He hasn&#146;t gotten out of that chair in two days.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! How&#146;s it going?</p>

<p>(Chandler imitates retching and gets out of the chair.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come
home. All right, uh, I&#146;ve got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me
and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Monica!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh-oh, what&#146;s the matter?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, it&#146;s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera.
So&#133; What are you gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t know sweetie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Help me!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&#146;t! I have to work!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is&#151;I have to meet Joshua! This
is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y&#146;know the &quot;Wouldn&#146;t it be
great if she was my wife&quot; Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, Chandler&#146;s still in Phase One, and Joey&#146;s that thing you
smell.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So&#133;.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhhh, come on!!!</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think she&#146;s here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You want me to take some girl I&#146;ve never met to the opera so you can
go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (looking out the peephole) Ohh, she&#146;s looking down the hall. Oh!
She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can&#146;t see people through that little hole, can
you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!</p>

<p><strong>Woman:</strong> Hello! (Monica screams)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I
thought we have moved on! I thought we&#146;ve gotten to a place where we could be happy
for each other! I mean was that just me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, I&#146;ll do it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.)
Emily?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m Rachel Green.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Thank goodness.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> There&#146;s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that
I&#146;m not free tonight. So&#133;</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Really?! Well, that&#146;s just lovely, isn&#146;t it? I must&#146;ve
missed your call, even though I didn&#146;t leave the flat all day. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh well, no I&#133;</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, no-no-no, that&#146;s not rude! It&#146;s perfectly in keeping with a
trip that I&#146;ve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been
strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone
who&#146;s got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I-I-I think you look great.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;ll get her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Please hurry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Don&#146;t you just <b>love</b> the way they talk?!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, the next morning, Monica and
Phoebe are eating breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It kicked! I think the baby kicked!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on
the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh wait, Joey, you can&#146;t go like that! You stink!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don&#146;t have
time! They&#146;re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. Run ten blocks, that&#146;ll help the smell.</p>

<p>(He opens the door to reveal Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey&#151;whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey
runs off.) Wow!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So? How did it go with Joshua last night?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I didn&#146;t see Joshua last night, <b>but</b> I did punch a girl
in the face.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got
there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and
she was all, &quot;I&#146;m Rachel Greep! I&#146;m Rachel Greep!&quot; and he let her
right in. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So you hit her in the face?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal
my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can&#146;t believe this, all I wanted was a few
hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, that&#146;s you&#146;re name.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called
each other!</p>

<p>(Chandler enters from his bedroom.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey! You&#146;re wearing pants!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s right! Where are the guys? I&#146;m ready to get drunk and
see some strippers.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s 9:30 in the morning!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> They got a breakfast buffet.</p>

<p>(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, let me talk to him!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh-oh, my God!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, can I just&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She&#146;s shhing me! It&#146;s my phone and she&#146;s shhing me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Shhh!! Please! What&#146;s he saying?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He&#146;s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What? Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Who the hell is Emily&#151;(realises) noooo!!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, scene continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> They&#146;re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms
franticly and hits Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ow!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How&#151;how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits
Chandler again.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe, she doesn&#146;t hit him all the time. </p>

<p>[cut to Ross in Vermont, talking on the phone.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who
wouldn&#146;t be miserable? I&#146;m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (rushing in) Ross! Come quickly! There&#146;s a deer just outside eating
fruit from the orchard!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;ve gotta go, there&#146;s a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)</p>

<p>[cut back to Chandler and Joey&#146;s.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He had to go, there&#146;s a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I&#146;m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into
the living room.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why do you care so much anyway?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t care! All right, y&#146;know what I&#146;m just upset that
I&#146;m getting nowhere with Joshua that&#151;y&#146;know what still, you do not meet
someone and go flitting off to Vermont!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, y&#146;know, would you just for <b>once</b>, not remember
every&#133;little&#133;thing!! (Storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So y&#146;know, uh, when&#146;s he getting back?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> A couple of days.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He
starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?! Chandler! You can&#146;t just go back a phase!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes you can. You&#146;re thinking about time, you can&#146;t go back
in time.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, look, why don&#146;t you just, why don&#146;t you do your Phase
Two strip club thing with us.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, come on, we can be guys!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (laughs) No you can&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You don&#146;t want to be guys, you&#146;d be all hairy and
wouldn&#146;t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&#146;know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and
you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (Starts to cry)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m sorry. (Goes and hugs him)</p>

<p>[Scene: Silvercup Studios, Joey is just arriving for his scene.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I&#146;m here! I&#146;m here! </p>

<p><b>The A.D:</b> Calm down, we got time, we&#146;re running a little late.</p>

<p>(Just then, Charlton Heston walks out of his dressing room and starts eating a
liquorice whip.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!</p>

<p><b>The A.D:</b> Yeah, we loves &#145;em. I&#146;ve never seen him with&#151;(He gets a
whiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (trying to act like he&#146;s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what
the hell is that? What smells so bad?</p>

<p><b>The A.D:</b> You.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&#146;know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who
I think it is?</p>

<p><b>The A.D:</b> You?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, it&#146;s uh, it&#146;s Heston.</p>

<p><b>The A.D:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and
then ate some liquorice. </p>

<p><b>The A.D:</b> There&#146;s no way he smells, he&#146;s the only one around here with
a shower in his dressing room.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?</p>

<p><b>The A.D:</b> The one with &quot;Heston&quot; on it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Interesting.</p>

<p>[Scene: A strip club, the girls are there with Chandler, who isn&#146;t enjoying
himself.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I&#146;ve
got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No thanks, Mom!</p>

<p>(A man sits down next to Phoebe and lights up a cigarette.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, &#145;cause
I&#146;m pregnant.</p>

<p><strong>The Cigarette Smoking Guy</strong>: (No, not the Cigarette Smoking Man from <i>The
X-Files</i>.) Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ha-ha, it&#146;s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)</p>

<p>(The dancer finishes and everyone claps.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer&#146;s hot
pants) so good.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn&#146;t
call. I mean you&#146;d think he&#146;d be worried about me not showing up at his club.
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on! Look where you are!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Remember, a virgin for me please.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh! And don&#146;t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet
guy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahh, come on! Y&#146;know what&#151;y&#146;know what, I think I&#146;m
just gonna go home and call Kathy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, if you think it will help.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I&#146;m gonna get really
drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that,
I&#146;m gonna get so drunk, I&#146;m gonna wanna call Janice</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You should! How is she?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohhh!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Silvercup studios, Joey is taking a shower in Charlton Heston&#146;s dressing
room. Heston enters the room, Joey panics, and walks over to the shower and confronts Joey
about the use of his shower.]</p>

<p><b>Charlton Heston:</b> Hello! Who&#146;s in there? (He opens to curtain to reveal a
naked and wet Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How ya doin&#146;?</p>

<p><b>Charlton Heston:</b> Who in the hell are you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I guess you wouldn&#146;t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?</p>

<p><b>Charlton Heston:</b> Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I&#146;m an actor, Joey Tribbiani,
I&#146;m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.</p>

<p><b>Charlton Heston:</b> (shocked) You&#146;re in <b>this</b> picture?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah-yeah, I&#146;m one of the cops that won&#146;t work with you
&#145;cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I&#146;m really sorry, but I stink!</p>

<p><b>Charlton Heston:</b> Joey, right?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Charlton Heston:</b> (tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the shower
and sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or another&#151;opp! (Joey tries to
sit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.) Every actor thinks he
stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won&#146;t even
watch himself.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no-no-no, you don&#146;t understand&#133;</p>

<p><b>Charlton Heston:</b> Listen to me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Charlton Heston:</b> I don&#146;t know one actor worth his salt that didn&#146;t say
at one time or another, &quot;God, I stink!&quot; Hell, I just did a scene out there,
first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter
how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and
use my shower! Do you understand me?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes sir! Yes sir, I&#146;m-I&#146;m&#151;(he starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Charlton Heston:</b> Wait a minute! Take your pants.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are
returning from the strip club.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, we did okay at the strip club, right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress
there is quitting to teach the third grade!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) I can&#146;t believe it! He still hasn&#146;t called.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Who, Josh?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&#146;s Joshua.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What, he doesn&#146;t like Josh?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I don&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, well I&#146;m gonna put my sweats back on.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y&#146;know what, you were right, you were
right. We really weren&#146;t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we&#146;re
girls.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And do you know what girls are really good at?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Stripping!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, listening! Sit! Y&#146;know, maybe it would just really, really help
if you would just talk.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, come on! What&#146;s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. And y&#146;know, if you wanna cry, that&#146;s okay too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, look, I&#146;m gonna have to ask you all to leave.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on! Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?
Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn&#146;t picture myself with any of them.
(Sits back in disgust.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> They really were pretty, weren&#146;t they? (Rachel and Phoebe both
agree)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Candy! She was so spunky! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is
intrigued.) It&#146;d, it&#146;d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so
petite.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> See, I don&#146;t know, for me it would have to Chantal.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Chantal!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that
dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am totally picturing you with all those women!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s-that&#146;s not Phase Three.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&#146;m there too!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, are we all together? Like in a group?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Stop it! You&#146;re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase
Four!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! What is that? What is that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where I don&#146;t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to
have sex with strippers and my friends!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the gang is there, minus Ross. Chandler is trying to cheer Joey
up about missing Phase Two.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, let me see that smile.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t wanna.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Please?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I wanted to go to the strip club!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, I know, but you&#146;re gonna have plenty of chances. There
are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey&#151;ooh so, how was Vermont?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Emily is&#133;incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it,
I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.)
Oh! And you! Rach!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! You were so right!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be
happy for each other. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hmm.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn&#146;t quite there. Y&#146;know, I mean the
thought of you and that-that Josh guy&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joshua.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joshua&#133;guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought
of it kinda&#133;y&#146;know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But now! I&#146;m there! I&#146;m totally there! I&#146;m-I&#146;m finally
where you are!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, thank goodness!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no problem. I&#146;m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She
playfully punches him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Happy for you. (He punches her back.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is there and is getting
ready to direct a bunch of strippers, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe on what to do in the
upcoming orgy of lesbian lust. Yes, it&#146;s a dream sequence, this isn&#146;t cable.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right ladies, here&#146;s what we&#146;re gonna do. (Points to a
stripper.) <b>You</b> are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two,
go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your
voice, &quot;Chandler&#146;s the king! Chandler&#146;s the king!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that&#146;s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, now, what am I doing again?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any
moment!</p>

<p><b>The Cigarette Guy:</b> Hi, I&#146;m Joshua, I&#146;m here to pick up Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no-no, that&#146; not Joshua.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What do you want from me, I&#146;ve never met the guy. So anyway,
Rachel, I&#146;m sorry you can&#146;t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with
the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a <b>lot</b> of work to do. (The cigarette guy
starts rubbing Chandler&#146;s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right,
listen, I&#146;ve got to wake up!</p>

<p>[Scene: A beauty parlour, Rachel is getting a manicure while Chandler, yes Chandler, is
getting a petticure (Does that scare you that I know those terms?&nbsp; Well, it scares
me.).]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!&nbsp; And <strong>you</strong>
said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is.&nbsp; Also, you said there would be
other guys here. There are no other guys here!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler, there&#146;s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s a mailman! That&#146;s <b>our</b> mailman! (Waves to the
mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler, don&#146;t worry! This doesn&#146;t make you any less of a
guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) <b>That</b> does!
(Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I <b>hate</b>
to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><strong>Woman: </strong>OH&#133;MY&#133;GAWD!! (Yep, you guessed it. It&#146;s Janice.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Joey are standing at
the counter. Monica is flipping a light switch on and off next to the door.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey let me ask you a question. <b>What</b> does this light switch do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh, Nothing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Didn&#146;t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it
did?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I <b>know</b> what it did! Nothing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> They wouldn&#146;t have put it there if it didn&#146;t do something! How
can you not care?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Like this. (Shrugs)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, here&#146;s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that
silver knob on the toilet does?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure! It flushes it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind
actually using it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Guess who we ran into today?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Janice?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Isn&#146;t this amazing? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How have you been?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh well, I&#146;m divorced.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohhh, wow.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Yeah, I&#146;m riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And there it is.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I just came up to say, &quot;Hi!&quot; Hi! (to Chandler) And you,
sweetie, I&#146;ll see you tonight.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. Bye.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Bye.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Bye.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Bye.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> B-bye!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Bye-bye.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it&#146;s closed) I
can&#146;t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?! I thought you were crazy about her!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before
we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality&#151;Well, they&#146;re all
back! Y&#146;know? And she&#146;s picked up like nine new ones!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So what are you doing bringing her here?! There&#146;s people here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Don&#146;t worry about it. I&#146;m taking care of it tonight.
(Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You are not. You have <b>never</b> been able to break up with her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don&#146;t have to break
up with her this time. We&#146;re not involved! I&#146;m going to do a pre-emptive strike!
I&#146;m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the
fridge.) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around
and then back at Joey.) I&#146;m tellin&#146; ya!</p>

<p>[Scene: A street, Ross and Emily are walking home from a date.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I can&#146;t believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such
stories about New York.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it&#146;s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly
safe.</p>

<p>(At that moment two very large men start screaming and running towards Emily and
picking her up.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Help! Help!! Help! Help!!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. (Introducing
them) Liam, Devon, this is Ross.</p>

<p><b>Devon:</b> Hey, mate.</p>

<p><b>Liam:</b> How are ya man?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> So how are you? I&#146;ve been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived
but umm, well, I&#146;ve been rather busy.</p>

<p><b>Devon:</b> Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that
U2 concert?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh my God. I think you&#146;re right.</p>

<p><b>Liam:</b> (puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw each
other was that morning.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something&#151;or
should I call it (In an English accent) football?</p>

<p><b>Devon:</b> We were playing rugby.</p>

<p><b>Liam:</b> In fact we&#146;re playing a game at the park tomorrow. You&#146;re
welcome to play too if you want.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (laughs) Ross play rugby? I don&#146;t think so.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What&#146;s ah, what&#146;s so funny about that?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Well I mean, you&#146;re American to start with. You don&#146;t even have
rugby here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, we didn&#146;t have <b>freedom</b> here until 1776, either so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Devon:</b> So good then! We&#146;ll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!</p>

<p><b>Liam:</b> Cheers!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Cheers!</p>

<p>(Liam and Devon both take a swig of their beers, while Ross takes a swig of his coffee.
The Brits both crush their cans, and not to be out done, Ross crushes his coffee cup,
spilling its contents.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is attempting his pre-emptive strike.]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh boy, I just love to sing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were
complaining though, was that they paid to hear the <b>actor</b> sing <i>Old Man River</i>.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, look at us! Who would&#146;ve thought that Cupid had a station at
14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I&#146;m just getting out of a very
serious relationship&#133;</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I know! And I&#146;m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about
meant to be!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away
this time.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me
overseas!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! No! Not, Paris. </p>

<p><b>Janice:</b>Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen.
That&#146;s right, yes, I&#146;m being transferred to Yemen!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> When?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t know exactly.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until
that moment comes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But I do know that it&#146;s some time tomorrow.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are plugging in
a bunch of electronics.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Done?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, with Joey) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! What&#146;s up?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and
checked every outlet. Now, four of them don&#146;t work. Which means, one of <b>them</b>
has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets
that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out
which one it is.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&#146;know, you-you also could&#146;ve used uh, <b>lamps</b> and then
followed the light.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well, I&#146;m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody
ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear
something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it&#146;s Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&#146;s coming from Joey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, that&#146;s so freaky! Turn him off!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are
watching rugby on TV as Phoebe enters.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, just hold on a second. I&#146;m watching this rugby thing on <i>ESPN</i>.
I don&#146;t know what the big deal is. I&#146;m man enough to play this sport.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, you&#146;re not even man enough to order the <b>channel</b> that
carries the sport.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (entering) Hey there Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (shocked) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (whispering to Ross) Janice.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know uh, you didn&#146;t really have to help me pack.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and
the time you leave is packing, you didn&#146;t really leave me much choice. Did you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did <b>not</b>!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey-hey, what&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I&#146;m packing. Y&#146;know I&#146;m-I&#146;m packing
&#145;cause I&#146;m moving to Yemen tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks for telling me!</p>

<p>(Janice runs into the bedroom.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m only going to pretend I&#146;m moving to Yemen, it&#146;s the
only way I can get rid off her.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, I&#146;m gonna show how
to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It&#146;s a real space saver.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I know, I do that &#145;cause it makes me look taller.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Okay, Chandler, come on!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can&#146;t believe you said
you&#146;d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I can handle it! All right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s &#145;cause-&#145;cause you&#146;re mom&#146;s dog kept-kept
looking at me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here.
That&#146;s called a scrum, okay? It&#146;s kinda like a huddle.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross! (Laughs) They&#146;re gonna kill you!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, why are you doing this anyway?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, you should&#146;ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I
mean, he&#146;s like Joe Rugby.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&#146;re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That&#146;s so funny.
(Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Anyway, she thought the very <b>idea</b> of me playing rugby with him was
like hilarious. So I&#146;m gonna show her how tough I really am!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m sorry.
You&#146;re right, you are a tough guy. You&#146;re the toughest palaeontologist I know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It&#146;s not like
he&#146;s&#133;Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (from his bedroom) Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, don&#146;t worry about me. Okay? I&#146;ll just stay real energetic
and stay away from the ball. I&#146;ll uh, I&#146;ll be that guy right out of the circle.
(He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin&#146; at him.</p>

<p>(Ross turns and wants to attack Rachel, but Joey stops him.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The park, everyone is warming up for the rugby game. Only Joey and Phoebe came
to support Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy
(Points). And that one&#151;Dude! They&#146;re all huge!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> They don&#146;t look any bigger than me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, maybe that&#146;s because you&#146;re closer to you. So you look
bigger to you from where you are.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I&#146;m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.) </p>

<p>(A player comes over and picks up a ball in front of Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to the player) Hi.</p>

<p>(The player stands up and smiles. Showing that he has no front teeth.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.</p>

<p>(The referee blows the whistle and the players gather to start the game.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I know what I have to do. I&#146;ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and
Phoebe don&#146;t know what he&#146;s talking about.) Y&#146;know, Red Ross!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I totally don&#146;t know what you&#146;re talking about.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for <i>Dances With Wolves </i>and
that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all
red! Red Ross!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You&#146;ll see.</p>

<p>[Cut to Emily, Devon, and Liam]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it&#146;s his
first time.</p>

<p><b>Liam:</b> You don&#146;t say! (We see Ross who is hopping about with the ball and
spikes it in his face.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (to Ross) Good luck, babe.</p>

<p>(The scrum forms and the game is underway.)</p>

<p><b>Liam:</b> Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!</p>

<p>(Ross walks over to the scrum, walks around a bit looking for a way to get into the
scrum.)</p>

<p><b>Liam:</b> Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!</p>

<p>(Ross, urged on by his team-mates, jumps on top of the scrum and falls headfirst into
the middle, leaving his feet sticking straight up.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> JOEY!!!!!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel&#146;s, Monica is going over some
plans as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You&#133;are&#133;not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today,
and guess what happened?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He asked you out?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Saucy!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (refers to the table) What are these?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Electrical plans for the building.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall
and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! If only more people knew.</p>

<p>[Scene: The airport, the Yemen Express counter, Chandler is still trying to get rid of
Janice.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know you, really didn&#146;t have to take me to the airport.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y&#146;know? Besides, somebody had
to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don&#146;t
really seem to care too much that you&#146;re leaving.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, we&#146;re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this
is uh, good-bye then.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> On no! No! It&#146;s not good-bye, I&#146;m not leaving until you get on
that plane.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. Then I guess it&#146;s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign
that says, Wait Here.&quot;) (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.</p>

<p><b>Ticket Counter Attendant:</b> One ticket to Yemen?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.</p>

<p><b>Ticket Counter Attendant:</b> I&#146;m sorry sir, I don&#146;t understand. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?</p>

<p><b>Ticket Counter Attendant:</b> Are you travelling with a child?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. All right, y&#146;know what, she&#146;s (Points to Janice) gonna
think that I&#146;m handing you a credit card, but what I&#146;m really gonna do is hand
you a library card.</p>

<p><b>Ticket Counter Attendant:</b> Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don&#146;t
take library cards.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> What&#146;s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to the ticket agent) <i>American Express</i>?</p>

<p>[Scene: The rugby game, Ross is getting killed.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I can&#146;t believe they&#146;re doing that to him! I told them to go
easy on him!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No offence but, y&#146;know sometimes it&#146;s hard to understand you,
y&#146;know with the accent, so&#133;</p>

<p>(The whistle blows.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> That&#146;s just halftime, there&#146;s more of this.</p>

<p>(Ross limps over all covered in mud.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle
of water? </p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. (When she&#146;s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I&#146;m
dying. I really do. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, poor baby.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.)
Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ross, they are killing you out there!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (whines &quot;No.&quot;) That&#146;s not true!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She&#146;s right! You have to stop!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? No! No, I&#146;m not stopping. I&#146;m Red Ross!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, if you go back out there, you&#146;re gonna be Dead Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help
you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> No. That&#146;s not what I&#146;m saying. I just may know a few things
that might help you inflict some pain.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I like that.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> One swift kick and he&#146;ll back off.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, bad ankle, got it!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh,
and David over there, I heard he doesn&#146;t wear a cup.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> And uh, Liam, Liam&#146;s got bad knees. You hit him right and he&#146;ll
go down like a lamp.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But-but, Liam&#146;s on my team.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I don&#146;t care! You just get him!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a
madman.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> The Red Ross! Okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel&#146;s, Monica is reading a book as
Rachel returns.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren&#146;t there
originally.) What-what are-what are these?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they&#146;d
brighten up the place. They do don&#146;t you think?</p>

<p>(Rachel rips one of the wall and finds a huge hole underneath.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no-no, no!</p>

<p>(Rachel rips off another one, revealing another hole. Rachel then moves onto a third
one, but this one doesn&#146;t have a hole underneath it.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know that there&#146;s no hole there, I just really liked that
picture.</p>

<p>(Rachel looks at it and then throws it away. She then removes a fourth one, revealing a
third hole.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! Look at this!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, but there <b>is</b> a wire back there! I mean that switch is
connected to something!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t care! The wires have come loose in your head!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it
did.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And did you?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there,
I thought it went downstairs.</p>

<p>(Rachel removes a paper on the floor which is covering a hole and gasps.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But it didn&#146;t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Chatracus:</b> Hello darling.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, They are returning from the rugby game, Joey and Emily are
carrying Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Now, are you sure you don&#146;t want to go see a doctor?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no! That-that&#146;ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I
was great! This is a great day! Y&#146;know what? I&#146;m buying everyone coffee. All
right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it&#146;s in my pocket. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, not you. (Emily gets it.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, look, your eye&#146;s still popping out a little, I&#146;m gonna go
get some ice.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and
the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> You were amazing out there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I kinda was, wasn&#146;t I?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven&#146;t done that since I
was four and I washed my dad&#146;s Porsche with rocks.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> You really enjoyed yourself didn&#146;t you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody
nose&#151;I mean I-I&#146;m not proud of it but, I really am. And it&#146;s all because of
you, wonderful, amazing you.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I think you&#146;ve got concussion.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, I&#146;m serious. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> You&#146;re welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he winces.) I&#146;m
sorry. Did I hurt you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y&#146;know what,
you know what? It&#146;s not.</p>

<p>[Scene: The airport, the flight to Yemen is being called.]</p>

<p><b>Ticket Counter Attendant:</b> (on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call for
Flight 664 to Yemen.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I-I guess I gotta go.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I&#146;ll wait for you. Do you even know how long
you&#146;re going to be gone?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh. Well, I&#146;ll right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen
Road, Yemen.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. </p>

<p>(He gives the agent his ticket and walks onto the jetway. Janice walks over and looks
out the window. Chandler walks back into the terminal and tries to walk right past Janice,
but she sees him.)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Chandler! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and
also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> No! No! I wanna see you take-off.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I then guess I&#146;m going to Yemen! I&#146;m going to Yemen!
(To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel&#146;s, Monica has finally given up
on her search to find what the light switch does and is now flicking it on and off
aimlessly.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right. The super couldn&#146;t figure out what it did. A $200 an
hour electrician couldn&#146;t figure out what it did. I&#146;ve had seven pretty serious
shocks. I officially give up.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank God.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler and Joey&#146;s, Joey and Phoebe are watching TV. The TV is turning
off and on, and each time Phoebe is blinking her eyes like the Genie did. The switch
obviously controls the outlet which the TV is plugged into.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> See? I&#146;m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops
working.) I lost it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are
there. Phoebe is stressing out about something.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is it hon?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I can&#146;t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes
me nauseous! I&#146;m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake&#151;ooh! Cake!
(Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aww, honey I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God! Ooh! What is that smell? It&#146;s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
(She goes to the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.</p>

<p>[Cut to the bathroom, Joey is taking a shower and Phoebe knocks on the door.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&#146;s me. It&#146;s Phoebe. Listen there&#146;s something in here I
want to eat, what-what smells so good?</p>

<p>(Joey sticks his head out of the shower curtain.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Is it the shampoo? It&#146;s guava.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (she smells his head) No!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. Yes. Yes. I can&#146;t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he
wants me to eat meat? I can&#146;t eat meat!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it&#146;s a pickle?!</p>

<p>(Phoebe grimaces at the smell.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Rachel are there. Rachel is writing
something on a pad, and then crumples it up and throws it on the floor.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you writing?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, Joshua&#146;s coming in tomorrow and since I don&#146;t have the
guts to ask him out, I&#146;m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a
call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style&#151;what did you throw away?</p>

<p>(Ross and Emily enter.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi guys!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, what have you guys been up too?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the
Cupert-Hewitt museum.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Without me?!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really
interesting.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! (Shows them a
doorknob she has.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t know how museums work in England but, here, you&#146;re not
supposed to take stuff.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.
(Chandler is shocked.) It&#146;s a joke. (They all laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Bye. (They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Right, I&#146;ve got to be off, I&#146;ll see ya. Buh-bye then. (She
leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah, she&#146;s-she&#146;s amazing. And-and she&#146;s so much fun.
And! Y&#146;know what? When I&#146;m with her, I&#146;m fun! I even signed up for
helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She&#146;s leaving in two days, I don&#146;t
have to do it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, she&#146;s got to go back to London. But you know what? I&#146;ve
been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and
that&#146;s it. Y&#146;know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey that&#146;s what all my relationships are like.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, but in Ross&#146;s case, they <b>both</b> know in two weeks
that&#146;s it.</p>

<p>(Phoebe enters.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is
totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make
it think it was getting meat, y&#146;know? And I got nauseous.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe that&#146;s because soy-burgers suck!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s sweat. You throw up all morning, you&#146;ll have that glow
too.</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Bloomingdale&#146;s</i>, Rachel is preparing to slip Joshua the note.]</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> (coming in from a changing room) Okay!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, here&#146;s that trench-coat that you wanted.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Oh great! (He tries on the coat.) Wow! Yeah, it&#146;s comfortable. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. (He goes to put his
hands in his pockets.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don&#146;t want you to put your
hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Why not?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, that&#146;s because of a lot of&#133;(She imitates someone picking
their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Y&#146;know, they ruin it for everybody.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Y&#146;know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, congratulations, so do you love her?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> No, no, no, she&#146;s nice but, y&#146;know, it just it made me realize
that I&#146;m just not, I&#146;m just not ready to be dating, y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh. Well, uh, that&#146;s uh, that&#146;s interesting. (She goes over
and retrieves her note.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> (noticing her) Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, it&#146;s just an anti-theft device.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Then uh, what&#146;s-what&#146;s this? (Shows her the real anti-theft
device.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You need that, you need that too &#145;cause obviously, a thief could
just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is writing on the <i>Magna-Doodle</i>
as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we
have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, what&#146; going on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it&#146;s
actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he&#146;s not ready to
date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I
have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, as much as I&#146;d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I
aren&#146;t going to be here. All right? I mean, she&#146;s going to come by first to say
good-bye, and then I&#146;ve got a whole special evening planned. So I&#146;m sorry, no
party.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Awwww!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (entering) Hello?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Surprise!!!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler and Joey:</b> Surprise!! </p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> No one&#146;s ever thrown me a surprise party before!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, it was all Ross&#146;s idea.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> You&#146;re so sweet! And I&#146;m so surprised!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You really didn&#146;t know?</p>

<p>[Cut to later, the party is in full swing. Rachel is in the kitchen and Chandler goes
over to talk to her.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to
the living room.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uhh, because I&#146;m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he&#146;s
looking over here, say something funny.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Like what?</p>

<p>(Rachel laughs hysterically.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What-what-what is so funny?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I said, &quot;Like what?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now that&#146;s a thinker.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, y&#146;know what, y&#146;know what? This playing hard to get thing
is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She
does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Care for a cherry?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Oh, no thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No? Y&#146;know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my
tongue. </p>

<p>(She tries to demonstrate this unique ability, but only succeeds in choking on it.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> You okay? (Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy
smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, but the party&#146;s only just getting started!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but we-we have to be at the<i> Four Seasons</i> for drinks in 15
minutes and then y&#146;know, then <i>The Plaza</i> for dinner.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> So why did you plan a party at the same time?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very
short. It&#146;s usually, &quot;Surprise!&quot; And then, &quot;Oh my God, I&#146;m so
surprised&#151;good-bye!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> But Ross, I&#146;m such having a great time! Your sister has just been
telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea
parties.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica&#146;s knee really hardly
and Monica winces in pain.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey and Phoebe in the kitchen. Phoebe is watching Joey make a sandwich.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> A little salami. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pastrami. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oooh, yeah. You&#146;re a genius.</p>

<p>(Rachel enters, she has changed clothes.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. (He goes over to her.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Up!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You changed?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And lucky means, more cleavage? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Does for me.</p>

<p>(Joey starts wiping lint off of her back, but goes at little too far and Rachel just
glares at him. He stops, gives her the &#145;okay&#146; symbol and walks away.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, God! Look at him, he&#146;s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab
him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> There was a seen in <i>Footloose</i>...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>Flashdance</i>.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She was a welder.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Were you like <b>in</b> the movie, or&#133; Anyway, she takes off
her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&#146;s not Christmas!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Or Spin the Bottle?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> He&#146;s not 11!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (with her coat on, she&#146;s leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for
this. It was really so thoughtful of you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? You&#146;re leaving?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, we have something we have to get to.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Uhh, yeah, I think I&#146;m going to take-off too.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! You guys can&#146;t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole
big thing planned!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What big thing?</p>

<p>[Cut to later, the whole group is seated on the floor and Rachel is explaining the
rules of Spin the Bottle.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the
bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where
Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther&#146;s face and decides
not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I&#146;ll go.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yay!</p>

<p>(Emily spins the bottle and it lands on Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)</p>

<p>(Joey spins the bottle and it lands on Emily.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Two in a row! You&#146;ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss
again.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yay! Emily! </p>

<p>(Emily spins the bottle and once again, it lands on Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are the odds? What are the odds?</p>

<p>(They both move to kiss again.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stopping them) Okay, that-that&#146;s enough! Y&#146;know, let&#146;s,
let&#146;s let someone else play.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> If you didn&#146;t want to play, why did you come to the party?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, my turn!!</p>

<p>(Rachel spins the bottle and it lands on&#133;.wait for it&#133;.Joshua. (You thought I
was going to say Ross, didn&#146;t you?) Rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy
crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her
cleavage.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Ohh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&#146;s okay! It&#146;s okay! It kicked once, it&#146;ll kick again!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p>(They all stand up and go over to Phoebe to feel the baby, preventing Rachel from
kissing Joshua.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. </p>

<p>(She crawls over to Joshua and kisses the back of his knee. He feels it and looks down,
Rachel pretends she&#146;s knocking a bug off his leg.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just a bug.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, it is later in the party. The
Spin the Bottle game is over and Chandler is making a sandwich as Phoebe watches.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&#146;know it doesn&#146;t matter how much I&#146;m craving it.
Y&#146;know why I&#146;m never gonna eat meat? Because it&#146;s murder, cold blooded
murder.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. </p>

<p>(He takes a bite out of the sandwich and as he does so, Phoebe attacks the other end
and starts devouring the sandwich.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There&#146;s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the
sandwich to Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&#146;t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right look, y&#146;know how-y&#146;know how when you&#146;re dating
someone and you don&#146;t want to cheat on them, unless it&#146;s with someone really
hot?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, totally!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you&#146;re going
to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!</p>

<p>[Cut to later, Phoebe is finishing off her steak.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Feel better now?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I&#146;m
gonna eat like, y&#146;know millions of cows.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I eat a lot of meat right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, suppose until the baby&#146;s born I laid off it. No extra animals
would die, you-you&#146;d just be eating my animals.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Joey, I can&#146;t believe you would do that for me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There&#146;s no meat in beer, right?</p>

<p>[Cut to Ross and Emily standing by the foosball table.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked
for our check right away.</p>

<p>(Rachel enters, she has changed once again. This time into her high school cheerleading
uniform.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> But, we can&#146;t go now. It looks like Rachel&#146;s gonna put on a
skit.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-n-n-n-no! I am <b>finally</b> thinking clearly. My lucky dress
wasn&#146;t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can&#146;t let&#151;(pause), actually
I kinda want to see what happens.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Nice uh, costume.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American <b>good</b>-bye
cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an &#145;E!&#146;</p>

<p><b>All:</b> E!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Gimme an &#145;M!&#146;</p>

<p><b>All:</b> M!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Gimme an &#145;I!&#146;</p>

<p><b>All:</b> I!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Gimme an &#145;L!&#146;</p>

<p><b>All:</b> L!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Gimme a &#145;Y!&#146;</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Y!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and
performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil&#151;Whoa!! (She falls in
Chandler&#146;s room.) Okay! So that&#146;s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther&#146;s
the only one that claps.)</p>

<p>(Joey and Monica rush over to her.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey and Monica:</b> Are you all right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m fine! I&#146;m fine! I&#146;m just losing a tooth, it&#146;s no
big deal. I have a dentist! Y&#146;know. I&#146;m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.
(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do
now?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think you&#146;re done.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Umm, that was <b>really</b> great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, come on, let&#146;s go get your coat.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(They both go to Chandler&#146;s bedroom to get his coat.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Gunther and Emily.]</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Rachel is my girlfriend.</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler&#146;s bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> So, this was uh, really fun.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y&#146;know, this bra&#133;
Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y&#146;know, this used to be my
bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a <b>lot</b> of memories. If these walls could
talk, y&#146;know what they&#146;d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently
pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn&#146;t co-operating.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Need uh, need a little hand there.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> You really don&#146;t seem like you do. That&#146;s&#133;</p>

<p>(She is still yanking on the bra, but it is stuck in her sleeve. Finally, she gives
up.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not
how this is supposed to happen.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Well, what was supposed to happen?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that
if I could get you here, I could seduce you.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Huh. Oh, boy! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I don&#146;t wear suits to
work, and I bought six of them from you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I&#146;m sorry, I thought you needed them!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted
to see you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why?!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Because I-I like you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You like me?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah! I mean you&#146;re-you&#146;re beautiful and smart and
sophisticated&#151;a lot of this isn&#146;t based on tonight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can&#146;t believe this, all
this time, I liked you and you liked me!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> But&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no-no-no don&#146;t say but! No-no, but&#146;s never good! Let&#146;s
just leave it at, you like me and I like you.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Okay uh, however&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, now see that&#146;s a fancy but.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> My marriage like <b>just</b> ended, and I&#146;m really not ready to get
into anything yet.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But&#133;.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> I&#146;m sorry, I, I just need a little time.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway, Ross is sitting on the step drinking a beer as Rachel comes out of
the guys apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua&#146;s gone so
you and Emily are free to go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s okay. She&#146;s still in there enjoying her fake party and
uh, it&#146;s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Ross, I&#146;m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Helps a little.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, have a seat.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just
didn&#146;t want it to end this way, y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, maybe you didn&#146;t want it to end?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You seem to really like her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y&#146;know no commitment.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica&#146;s photo albums, I mean you
don&#146;t do that if you&#146;re just in it for two weeks.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You think?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
you&#146;re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, you&#146;re right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God! Those weren&#146;t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
(He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You&#146;re a pathetic loser, right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-ho, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sit!</p>

<p>(He does so, and immediately starts looking pathetic.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Hi. (He has just returned.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my gosh, Joshua!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> All those things I said about not being ready&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> They&#146;re not true?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> No, they&#146;re-they&#146;re all true.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> But&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Oh, I love that but.</p>

<p>(They move to kiss, but realise that Chandler is staring at them. Chandler urges them
on.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You wanna go inside and have some coffee?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, the next day. Phoebe is busy
making a sandwich.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oooh, what you got there?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Pastrami.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y&#146;know what goes good with that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hm-mm, corn beef.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that&#146;s much better. How about a
little of that smoked turkey?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is
the baby due?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Six months.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those
right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not if I get there first.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching TV, and we
hear Mr. Treeger in the bathroom.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b> Ohhh, man!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Treeger&#146;s snaking the shower drain.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b> What in the name of hell?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe he found you flip-flop.</p>

<p>(Joey sits down and changes the channel, and we see two people making out.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must&#146;ve hit something on the
remote.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do we pay for this?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, we didn&#146;t even pay our cable bill&#151;maybe this is how they
punish us.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe we shouldn&#146;t pay our phone bill&#151;free phone sex.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe we shouldn&#146;t pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he
just said.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b> (coming in from the bathroom) Whoa, hey, that lady&#146;s all kinds
of naked.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b> Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the
channels and bam! It was like finding money.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Like finding money with naked people on it!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Treeger:</b> Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back
again. And I&#146;m sad. (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that morning. The porn is
still on, there are three women getting ready to shave the chest of some guy. Joey and
Chandler are wondering why that guy is letting them shave his chest, and Monica and Rachel
are eating breakfast at the foosball table.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, y&#146;know what, come on, do we really have to watch this
while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey and Chandler:</b> (stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We don&#146;t know what could make this go away.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And no one touches the <b>air</b> around the TV!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well at least, I&#146;m going to mute it.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey and Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look
behind them)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We still have porn.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, what are you doing? That&#146;s too heavy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica
right away.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, I&#146;m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid
massage table. Y&#146;know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She
goes over and stands in front of the TV.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Or a job where you don&#146;t have to carry a table.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You mean like a doctor?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs! You&#146;re blocking the porn! Look out!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN
today.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So uh, Emily just went to the airport.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. Why didn&#146;t you take her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y&#146;know, we-we
said our good-byes this morning, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Thinks about it.) Nah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, cheer up! You&#146;re gonna see her again, right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I, that&#146;s the thing, I don&#146;t know! I mean, whenever I
brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) &quot;This is so fantastic! Why do
we have to talk about the future? Let&#146;s just enjoy&#133;&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting him) No-no-no, don&#146;t-don&#146;t do the accent.
You&#146;ve <b>got</b> to see her again.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And why do you care so much?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You had fantasies about Emily?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Y&#146;know, <b>the</b> fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land,
fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that
Ukrainian kid?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ahh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you love her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We said it was only going to be two weeks, y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You love her!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What-what is love really?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohhh, I <b>knew</b> you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport
and tell her. You&#146;re probably just gonna catch her just as she&#146;s about to go to
the gate. You&#146;re gonna call out her name and say, &quot;I love you!&quot; And
she&#146;s gonna say, &quot;I love you, too!&quot; And you guys are going to have the most
amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I am a good kisser.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to
heat up, and then a stewardess comes in&#133; (Ross looks at her.) I&#146;ve been watching
too much porn.</p>

<p>[Scene: Beth Israel Medical Center, Phoebe is at her OB-GYN doing an ultrasound, Rachel
is with her. We here the baby&#146;s heartbeat.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is that the heartbeat?</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> That&#146;s it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wow! This is so cool.</p>

<p>(The heartbeat changes, and we hear a different one.)</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why don&#146;t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again,
I&#146;ll hold onto your card, okay?</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> No, I&#146;m getting three separate heartbeats.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Three? You guys were worried I wouldn&#146;t even have one!</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> Doctors are wrong all the time.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> Definitely. (Points out each head on the ultrasound.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months
I&#146;m going to have three full grown babies just walkin&#146; around inside me?! Oh!
Oh! And it&#146;s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> Actually, giving birth to three babies isn&#146;t that different
from giving birth to one.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What do you know?!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there, waiting to tell Frank and Alice the news.]</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> (entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Hi! (She runs over and hugs Phoebe&#146;s stomach.) So, how did it go at
the doctors?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh well, okay, hey, y&#146;know how when you&#146;re umm, you&#146;re
walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, &quot;Oh,
that&#146;s nice?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, yeah well, good news, you&#146;re going to have three babies.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Three babies?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> I finally got my band!</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> We&#146;re gonna have a big family, I&#146;ve always wanted a big family!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh God, I&#146;m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were
going to be all freaked.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Why would we be freaked?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no maybe &#145;cause it&#146;s harder to raise them, and the added
expense, and&#133;</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> (They&#146;re less than happy now) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, back to happy. Back to happy!</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> No-no-no, no, it&#146;s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach
Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y&#146;know
it&#146;ll-it&#146;ll be like my very own little sweatshop. </p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah, I&#146;ve been thinking ever since you said we were having
triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> No, Frank.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No you can&#146;t quit college! No! You&#146;re in college? Really?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah, refrigerator college.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah, y&#146;know when we found out we were going to have a baby,
y&#146;know I figured y&#146;know like I should y&#146;know have like a career&#151;and I
love refrigerators!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You can&#146;t give up on your dream.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> No, it&#146;s okay. We&#146;re-we&#146;re gonna have three kids! And
that&#146;s-that&#146;s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.</p>

<p>[Scene: The airport, Emily is getting ready to board her flight to London.]</p>
<b>

<p>Ticket Agent:</b> (On the P.A.) This is the boarding call for Flight 009.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Emily! (Runs up.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> You are so sweet. (They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s, that&#146;s, that&#146;s a big candy bar. (She&#146;s holding
one of those huge <i>Toblerone</i> bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Me too.</p>
<b>

<p>Ticket Agent:</b> This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Well, that&#146; me. (They kiss again.) Here, have this. (She gives him
the candy bar.) I&#146;m only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. (She starts towards the
jetway.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm,
I&#146;ve been thinking, I&#146;m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I
think I love you.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh. (She&#146;s shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s no problem.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Rachel is singing some kind of
song.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&#146;s that song? It has been in my head all day long.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s the theme from Good Will Humping.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&#146;know who doesn&#146;t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend
Joshua.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was
corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, he likes porn.</p>

<p>(Rachel starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Where ya going?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too
skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How did it go with Frank and Alice?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is
having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I
want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, &#145;cause you work for a big company.
Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> They don&#146;t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get
you some free white out though.</p>

<p>(Ross enters.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I did.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And well, what did she say?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you&#146;re totally welcome! What&#146;d she say?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; I said, &quot;I love you.&quot; And she
said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What do I do now?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You play hard to get.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She already lives in London.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Then you go to Tokyo.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,
it&#146;s over.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It is not over! You&#146;re over!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (Pause) Good one.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves
you. And the reason why she couldn&#146;t, is because her feelings were so strong, it
scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the
plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay! Okay! But if she doesn&#146;t call, it is definitely over! No, wait.
Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y&#146;know just to she what&#146;s going on, and,
and she says she&#146;ll call me back, but then she doesn&#146;t. <b>Then</b> it&#146;s
over.</p>

<p>(Joey holds his fist up, and Chandler gives him two thumbs up.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Way to be strong, man!</p>

<p>(Ross leaves, and after the door closes, Joey gives him the loser sign.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Joey enter having
just woken up.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn
break. We spent the last two hours watching In &amp; Out &amp; In, Again.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, so, why don&#146;t you just turn it off?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you&#146;re hear! Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what-what &#145;cha got there?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh this, well I&#146;m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a
knife and an soda can.) Now, don&#146;t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an
ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you&#146;re
thinking&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pregnant Woman Slays Four?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, they didn&#146;t make you pay for those knives, did they?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, you&#146;re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice
just by selling knives.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second
part of my plan.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What&#146;s the second part of your plan?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> My <i>Saturn</i> dealership.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s bedroom, he has fallen asleep waiting for Emily to call. He is
awaken by the phone.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Answers the phone.) Hello?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those
wonderful things.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, that-that, that&#146;s all right. Umm, I&#146;m just glad you
called.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ross umm, there&#146;s something that I&#146;ve got to tell you,
there&#146;s-there&#146;s someone else.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is relating his recent
conversation with Emily to the gang.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She doesn&#146;t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This isn&#146;t how it&#146;s supposed to go, there can&#146;t be
another guy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Of course there&#146;s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you
have to prove your love!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m not proving anything. Okay, I&#146;m done listening to you. If I
hadn&#146;t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never
would&#146;ve put my fist through the wall!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You put your fist through the wall?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> <b>You</b> have to go to London!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, you have to go fight for her!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. &#145;Cause you already told her
you love her and she didn&#146;t say it back, then she called you and told you that
there&#146;s another guy, so yeah, go to London that&#146;ll scare her!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I made fun of his accent.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You sat back and let him have her, you didn&#146;t fight at all. Am I
right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be
you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don&#146;t let her go
without a fight!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right. All right, I&#146;m gonna do it! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m gonna, I&#146;m gonna go to London and I&#146;m going to fight
for her.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, good luck!</p>

<p>(Ross starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross! Ross! If you&#146;re going to the airport, could you pick me up
another one of those <i>Toblerone</i> bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are
sitting and talking as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I&#146;m
gonna open up my own massage place and Frank&#146;s gonna help me! And! We can work it
around his schedule so he doesn&#146;t have to quit school!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys
used for catering and we realised&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m telling it! I&#146;m telling it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need
massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the
massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know
what I&#146;ve got?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> A place where no one will ever get out alive?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! Think about it, it&#146;s a taxi that people take when they need to
relax, it&#146;s&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> The name was my favourite part!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, well I can up with it!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <b>YOU DID NOT</b>!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That&#146;s
not good.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I&#133;</p>

<p>(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?</p>

<p>[Cut to Ross in one of those British phone booths.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, because she hasn&#146;t come home yet. And she hasn&#146;t been home
all night! She&#146;s obviously staying with that other guy, and I&#146;m the stupid moron
who spent the whole night outside her apartment!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right. When is, when is the next flight out?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> About four hours.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn&#146;t show
up by then, then just come on home.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks
that&#146;s better than Relaxi Cab.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, it&#146;s not Relaxi Cab. It&#146;s Relaxicab, like taxicab. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, that is better.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same night. There is a
knock on the door and Chandler answers it to reveal Emily standing behind it.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are we in London?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing here? You can&#146;t be here!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I&#146;ve uh, I&#146;ve come to talk to Ross.</p>

<p>(She sets her bag down on the foosball table and Joey sees the <i>Toblerone </i>bar
sticking out of it and gazes longingly at it.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I was going to call him, but&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I
was right! (Points to Emily) I&#146;m right, right?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I&#146;d really rather talk to him. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I uh, I&#146;ve been to his apartment and he wasn&#146;t there, and uh. I
need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?</p>

<p>[Cut to London, we sit Ross sitting outside Emily&#146;s apartment. We hear
Emily&#146;s phone ring with <b>amazing</b> clarity. Apparently, sound travels quite
easily through the walls of British buildings. Anyhoo, Ross looks around for the ringing
phone and in the meantime Emily&#146;s answering machine picks up and once again with
amazing clarity we hear Emily say&#133;]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ross, are you there? Ross, I don&#146;t know if you can hear this
but&#133; (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) I&#146;m
gonna talk anyway, uh, I&#146;m in the States with you sister and your friends and
it&#146;s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you&#151;Yes,
Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you
that I love you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all
the way to New York.) I love you too! I&#146;m, I&#146;m gonna call you right now from the
phone booth! (Realises) You can&#146;t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I wish I could know if you&#146;d heard any of that. I suppose I&#146;ve
either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if
you&#146;re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there&#146;s
not much chance you did heard that, and there&#146;s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh
well. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ross, I love you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh! Thank you.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she
didn&#146;t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over,

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What, no, &quot;Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Noo! Nothing!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are there as Phoebe enters carrying a drum.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! Wow, it <b>is</b> true what they say, pregnant bellies look like
a drum.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it&#146;s just
I&#146;m so pregnant that I&#151;my guitar doesn&#146;t fit anymore. So I thought
&#145;til I&#146;m not, I&#146;m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds <b>really</b>
cool!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) <i>Smelly cat, smelly
cat, what are they feeding you? </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know! I know, and I&#146;ve only been playing for like an hour!</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> (entering) Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! What are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, well, don&#146;t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my
uterus.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> (laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl
baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wouldn&#146;t that be Frank the III?</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> Don&#146;t get me started. (To Phoebe) Anyway, umm, since there are three
babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named
the other boy baby.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! That&#146;s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> You think about it. (Leaves)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don&#146;t think your son will
think it&#146;s yours and be horribly traumatised? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (checks the clock) Ohh, it&#146;s time to go.</p>

make any suggestions&#133;</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, there&#146;s tonnes of terrific stuff&#151;I&#146;ll go with you!</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Ahh!</p>

<p>(Ross accidentally, on purpose, bumps into Susan.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Are you all right?</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Oh, he&#146;s fine. He&#146;s fine. It&#146;s just that us getting along
is difficult for him, because he doesn&#146;t like me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh come on! That&#146;s-that&#146;s&#133; true.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are playing
foosball as Phoebe enters.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a
book) and found nothing! I want a name that&#146;s really like, y&#146;know strong and
confident, y&#146;know? Like-like Exxon. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I&#146;m-I&#146;m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name
starting with &quot;The.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey&#146;s your pal. Joey&#146;s your
buddy. &quot;Where is everybody?&quot; &quot;Well, they&#146;re hanging out with
Joey.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, y&#146;know what, if you&#146;re gonna do that, if you&#146;re
gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn&#146;t think so.) Oh,
come on! Chandler&#146;s funny, sophisticated, and he&#146;s very loveable, once you get
to know him.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh well, hey, Joey&#146;s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if
you need him, he&#146;ll be there.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a
little late, but-but, he&#146;ll be there. And he&#146;ll bring you some cold soda, if
want you need him for is that you&#146;re really hot.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What do ya say? What do ya say?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey
and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I
don&#146;t&#151;maybe I&#146;ll just name him The Hulk.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I knew I shouldn&#146;t have mentioned it! That&#146;s what I wanted to
name my kid!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica is cooking and Rachel is
getting ready for a date with Joshua.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time
tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She&#146;s holding two frilly,
lace nighties.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know what? It <b>really</b> creeps me out choosing other
people&#146;s sex clothes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sorry. I&#146;m so exited! I&#146;ve been waiting for this for months! I
got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I&#146;m making him a <b>very</b> fancy meal. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Um-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What am I making him by the way?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, you&#146;re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine
nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I thought I was making him filet mignon? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left
over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it,
then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to
make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe are
there as Ross enters.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So uh, Emily called last night&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And <b>now</b> you&#146;re giving me the message!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Turns out them Emily is just <b>crazy</b> about Susan. Yeah, they&#146;re
going to the theatre together! They&#146;re going to dinner! They&#146;re going horseback
riding!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God, Susan is so fun!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six
months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: &quot;My friend Susan is so smart. My
friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, they&#146;re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching!
Y&#146;know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful&#151;didn&#146;t
you see <i>Personal Best</i>?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, but I&#146;m gonna!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi! Hi! You&#146;re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married
her!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I definitely. I don&#146;t like the name Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What a weird way to kick me when I&#146;m down.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! No! I-I meant for the baby!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. What&#146;s wrong with Ross?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it&#146;s just y&#146;know that something like this would never to
like The Hulk, y&#146;know&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Actually that-that&#146;s not true, in <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> uh, No.
72, Dr. Bruce Banner found&#133; (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y&#146;know,
ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend&#146;s a lesbian. (Leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, I decided I&#146;m definitely going to go with either Joey or
Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named
Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Raymond Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Someone you didn&#146;t make up!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, there are <b>no</b> famous Joey&#146;s. Except for, huh, Joey
Buttafucco.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, that guy really hurt us.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it&#146;s like
y&#146;know, Chanoey?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he&#146;ll
never be President. There&#146;s never gonna be a President Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right look man, I didn&#146;t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is
the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It&#146;s not even a name; it&#146;s barely
even a word. Okay? It&#146;s kinda like chandelier, but it&#146;s not! All right?
It&#146;s a stupid, stupid <b>non</b>-name!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, you&#146;re, you&#146;re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;m sorry man, I didn&#146;t&#151;I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m
sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So I guess it&#146;s Joey then!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is on her dinner date with
Joshua.]</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (taking a bite) Hmmm!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh I know, my God, this is so&#151;this rice is so&#151;I am so good.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Behind you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I&#146;m sorry. They used to
live here; sometimes they migrate back over.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> (getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some way
they can not be here. It&#146;s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.</p>

<p>(Rachel gets up and ushers them into the hall, as they pass Joshua, he leaps onto the
counter to avoid them. Rachel drops them off in the hall, and knocks on Joey&#146;s door.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings
them inside.)</p>

<p>[Cut back to Rachel&#146;s date.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All gone! So, farm birds, huh?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, it&#146;s-it&#146;s my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I
would&#146;ve told you about it, but I didn&#146;t know they would be here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> So, all right.</p>

<p>(They both sit back down.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. So, can I serve you a little of&#151;What? What? What? (She sees
that Joshua isn&#146;t relaxed.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Nothing I uh, it&#146;s just that I know that they&#146;re still out
there.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But, they&#146;re across the hall! I mean that&#146;s two doors away, it
would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Okay, that&#146;s-that&#146;s not funny. Uhh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, y&#146;know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I
mean we could pack all this stuff up and y&#146;know go to your apartment.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Oh, they&#146;re working on this week, it&#146;s a total mess. But uh,
I&#146;m staying at my parents&#146; house, we could go there.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Your parents&#146;?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, they&#146;re out of town.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah-yeah, it&#146;s this <b>huge</b> place, and-and it&#146;s got this
gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah that works.</p>

<p>(He moves to kiss her, but stops when he hears the duck.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> They-they-they can smell fear.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s apartment, Carol has come to pick up Ben.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (opening the door.) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Hey! How&#146;s Ben?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, &quot;No.&quot; I asked
him if he wanted to sleep, he said, &quot;No.&quot; I asked him what he wanted to do, he
said, &quot;No.&quot; So, he&#146;s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a
dustpan.)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Hey, Ben! Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So umm, any word from Susan?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ooh, yeah! She said she&#146;s having sooo much fun with Emily.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I
don&#146;t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> What&#146;s too much fun?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&#146;know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh my God, you are <b>so</b> paranoid! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Am I?!</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> <b>Am I</b>?!</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> I can&#146;t speak for Emily, but <b>Susan</b> is in a loving, committed
relationship.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,
Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y&#146;know? Say-say they&#146;re
coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,
they&#146;re laughing, y&#146;know, someone innocently touches someone else&#133;
There&#146;s electricity, it&#146;s new. It&#146;s exciting. Are you telling me there
isn&#146;t even the slightest possibility of something happening?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Maybe.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OH MY GOD!! I didn&#146;t really believe it until you just said it!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Joshua&#146;s parents&#146; apartment, Rachel and Joshua are entering.]</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> &#133;and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to
God, that duck pushed me!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! This place is fabulous!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living
room.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa-whoa, there&#146;s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this
place must&#146;ve been a real babe magnet.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, well, it would&#146;ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?</p>

<p>(They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Hey, here&#146;s an idea. Why don&#146;t uh, I put the food in the
fridge and we can eat it later?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Oh yeah, yeah uh, it&#146;s down the hall and uh, second door to your
left.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ah.</p>

<p>(She goes down the hall. Joshua goes to put the food away when his parents walk in.)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Burgin:</b> Oh, hi, darling!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Burgin:</b> Oh, well we cut the trip short.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Burgin:</b> France sucks!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Burgin:</b> Oh, say no more!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Burgin:</b> We&#146;ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs,
and we&#146;ll be right out of you hair.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn&#146;t even get to Italy?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Burgin:</b> Yep, sucks!</p>

<p>(They all go into the kitchen. Just then, Rachel comes back from the bathroom; she had
removed her dress and is wearing nothing but a lace nightie. She tries to find someplace
seductive to wait for Joshua. She tries to sit on the piano, but it makes too much noise.
So she goes over to the couch and kinda half lays down to wait for Joshua. Joshua comes in
from the kitchen, sees Rachel, and freezes.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi you!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I can do more than cook.</p>

<p>(Just then, his parents enter. Rachel gasps.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Burgin:</b> I like her. She sees smart.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Joshua&#146;s parents&#146; apartment, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Uhh, Rachel, my parents&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! It&#146;s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their
hands.) Hello. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Burgin:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Burgin:</b> Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is
not&#151;that&#146;s-that&#146;s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see
and-and, this is a real dress actually. It&#146;s-it&#146;s, they&#146;re-they&#146;re
wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people
respond, and then I report back to my superiors at <i>Bloomingdale&#146;s</i>, so&#133;
And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report
back, &quot;USA not ready.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Burgin:</b> Maybe in L.A?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> There you go.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Burgin:</b> So, have you kids eaten yet?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, we were going to do that after&#151;I mean umm, next.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Burgin:</b> Well, we&#146;re starving, why don&#146;t we all go get something to
eat?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah, well&#133; Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin&#146;
around the house. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Burgin:</b> So&#133; We go eat.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Burgin:</b> You&#146;ll wear that. We&#146;ll be eating, and of course,
you&#146;ll be wearing that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is looking for a new
name in Phoebe&#146;s book of names.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, I am sorry about what I said!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, you&#146;re right, it is a ridiculous name!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s not that bad.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So, you&#146;re just Bing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I have no name.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, Gene.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s Clint. It&#146;s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s Clint! <b>Clint</b>!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe and Monica of her date.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, you wore your nightie to dinner?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled
water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, no!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it&#146;s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there
heads in agreement.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she
and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So! Poetry? Susan&#146;s gay! They&#146;re being gay together!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Emily&#146;s straight.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, wake up!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, Carol really messed you up!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,
sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don&#146;t know what sycophant means,
but the rest is right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I don&#146;t know what you&#146;re talking about, I am not a crazy,
jealous person.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> She&#146;s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out
about Mark and there was nothing going on.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This totally makes sense!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It does not!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren&#146;t jealous at all even
though <b>all</b> your girlfriends were cheating on you!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, all right, so up until &#145;92-93 he was very trusting, then
&#146;94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Absolutely! Absolutely!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This is so much fun!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is <b>not</b> fun!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, all we&#146;re trying to say is, don&#146;t let what happened with
Carol ruin what you got with Emily.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. The &#146;92 Ross wouldn&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&#151;yeah&#151;what, y&#146;know what? I hope Emily <b>is</b> a
lesbian.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is showing off more of her
drum skills to Joey by rubbing one of the sticks back and forth across the drum.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Drum roll.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nah, you&#146;re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good
Barney.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down
to the courthouse.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&#146;re actually going through with this?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,
it&#146;s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with
women&#133; So, as of 4 o&#146;clock tomorrow, I&#146;m either gonna be Mark Johnson or
John Markson.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got
to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact&#151;yes, (To Joey) I&#146;m, I&#146;m sorry. I
know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I&#146;m-I&#146;m, I&#146;m
gonna, I&#146;m gonna name the baby Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pleased) Really?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You wanna hug it out?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p>(They both hug.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yay! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yay! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yay&#151;oh&#151;yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, uh&#133; (She grabs her coat and runs out.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, bye! </p>

<p>(She exits, and after the door is closed, Chandler turns to Joey and&#133;)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby
Chandler.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s bedroom; Rachel is awoken by a man singing in the next
apartment.]</p>

<p><b>The Singing Man:</b> (singing, duh) Morning&#146;s here! Sunshine is here! The sky
is clear, the morning&#146;s here! The morning&#146;s here!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> HEY!! Do you <b>have</b> to do that? It&#146;s Saturday!</p>

<p><b>The Singing Man:</b> Oh come on! Morning&#146;s here! (Starts singing)
Morning&#146;s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!</p>

<p>(Rachel slams shut her window and storms into the living room, where Joey and Monica
are eating breakfast.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I <b>hate</b> this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate
the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning&#146;s here!
Morning is here&#151;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, you don&#146;t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the
floor!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know what? I am <b>really</b> tired of your bellyaching! Okay,
I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See, this is a <b>great</b> apartment.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Shut up! This place is a hole!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s bedroom; Ross and Emily are making out. Ross as a new feature.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, blimey, I still can&#146;t believe you&#146;ve got an earring!</p>

<p>(Yep, it&#146;s a little gold loop.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around,
pretending like he&#146;s jamming.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> He does that?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, I don&#146;t know, whatever.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I think it makes you look really dangerous.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I know. Y&#146;know what, I never would&#146;ve gotten this if it
weren&#146;t for you. No really, when I&#146;m with you I&#146;m-I&#146;m like this whole
other guy, I <b>love</b> that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love
that guy!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I love both of you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p>(They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I wish I didn&#146;t have to go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Then don&#146;t. Stay here. Just don&#146;t go so soon to London, just one
more day.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ohh, Ross, please!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> One more day, seriously/</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Don&#146;t do this to me, again. You&#146;d know I&#146;d stay here in a
minute, but I&#146;d really miss so much work, they&#146;ll fire me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, then you can stay as long as you want.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I wish I could.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no. Don&#146;t, don&#146;t, don&#146;t start packing. Come on! (She
puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I don&#146;t think you understand packing. Look, I just don&#146;t want
to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> You didn&#146;t!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. No, I didn&#146;t. I didn&#146;t want to be <b>that</b> guy.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are watching
one of those Kung Fu movies and imitating the moves.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ho! Ho! Ho!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Excuse me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Your pants!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah! You like &#145;em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and
got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesn&#146;t get it.) Santa Claus&#146;s
pants.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nuh-uh! They&#146;re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby
names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who&#146;s been naughty and who&#146;s been
nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.)
Ohh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So&#151;Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&#146;t know! How are the-the-the-the, y&#146;know&#151;You&#146;re
clothes aren&#146;t funny.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uhh, a T-shirt that says, &quot;I don&#146;t belong here.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You have Knicks tickets?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, my mom got my dad&#146;s season tickets in the divorce, so she
just gave them to me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, apparently, they&#146;re pretty good seats.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you guys want these?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah we do!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, well you got &#145;em.</p>
<b>

<p>Both:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just give us our apartment back!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Boy! I didn&#146;t see that coming!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, what, do you think we&#146;re stupid?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You&#146;re not stupid. You&#146;re meaner than I thought.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What do you say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Forget it! Okay, I&#146;m not giving up my bachelor pad for some
basketball seats!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You&#146;re bachelor pad?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Have you even had a girl up here?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you do!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is whining to Chandler about the tickets.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Good one.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Forget it! Okay, I&#146;m not giving up the apartment.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh come&#151;look, when I was a kid my dad&#146;s company gave season
tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad <b>never</b> won! Of
course, he wasn&#146;t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We don&#146;t make enough fun of you already?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You do know that Wham broke up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I like it, and Emily likes it, and that&#146;s what counts. So uh, how are
you guys doing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-no, don&#146;t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where is Emily?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ugh, she&#146;s saying good-bye to her uncle.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Man, didn&#146;t she like just get here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!! Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Easy tiger.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the
airport, it&#146;s-it&#146;s so great. But at the same time I&#146;m thinking, &quot;Well,
I&#146;m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So what are you going to do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nothing! There&#146;s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.
I mean, she-she&#146;d have to uh, move here. She <b>should</b> move here!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I could ask her to live with me!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because you&#146;ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I&#146;ve got
a carton of milk in my fridge I&#146;ve had a longer relationship with!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look guys, when I&#146;m with her it&#146;s-it&#146;s-it&#146;s like she
brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And I love the milk! But, I&#146;m not gonna some British girl to move
in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right look, Ross, he&#146;s right. Emily&#146;s great, she&#146;s
great! But this way too soon, you&#146;re only gonna scare her!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t want to do that.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! You don&#146;t want to wreck it, you don&#146;t want to go to fast!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, no, you&#146;re right, I know, you&#146;re right, I&#146;m not,
I&#146;m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same day. Joey and
Chandler are eating pizza, and Phoebe is trying to knit something.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s too hard. Too hard!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Or I&#146;ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No thank you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let&#146;s trade! The
timing&#146;s perfect, I just clogged the toilet! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we
can&#146;t leave in the small apartment after we&#146;ve lived here! Didn&#146;t you ever
read <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes! Didn&#146;t you ever read <i>Sports Illustrated</i>?! No! I
didn&#146;t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot
more than just season seats.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s the Knicks!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Screw the Knicks!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I didn&#146;t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so
much more.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And the Knicks rule all.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, the Knicks rule all!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. No. We&#146;re not gonna do that, y&#146;know why? Because its not
an even trade.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the
tickets?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Done!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let me finish. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m talking about a bet, winner takes all.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, we could end up with nothing.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Or you could end up with everything.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, I like that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, so what do you say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, just do it!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Op, op, I&#146;m convinced!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on man, you know I&#146;d do it for you! Because, you&#146;re my best
friend.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, but you can&#146;t use that again for a whole year.
I&#146;m in.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she&#146;s
the only who&#146;s impartial, and she&#146;s so pretty.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh&#151;oh, I have a game!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is great!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What&#146;s the game?! What&#146;s the game?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, well, it doesn&#146;t have a name&#151;oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it
doesn&#146;t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> They&#146;re green?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good! Good! Five points!</p>

<p>(They both rejoice; Chandler is totally confused.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, Joey, same question.</p>

<p>(He looks to Chandler, who doesn&#146;t have a clue.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, they&#146;re tall.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy,
leafy.</p>

<p>(Joey turns and is angry that Chandler didn&#146;t come up with the answer.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s not even a game!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Shut up! We&#146;re winning!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high
card wins. What do you say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fine, let&#146;s do it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I have cards!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the
trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s a low one!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!</p>

<p>(Both Joey and Chandler and Monica and Rachel jump up and down for joy.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why are you screaming and hugging?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because we won our apartment back!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!</p>

<p>(They all look to Phoebe to settle this.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&#146;t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.)
Ah-ha!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, cut, let&#146;s pick again, pick again.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen
is high!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh-huh, not as high as&#133;(picks a card) It worked! King!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah baby!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But, we pick again! We pick again!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&#146;t know!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That&#146;s courtside
baby!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them,
but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment
back!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No they didn&#146;t!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s apartment, Emily has packed as Ross returns.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (laughs) Move in with me.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Don&#146;t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say
it&#146;s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> My job!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, so, you-you&#146;ll get a job here! I mean, I&#146;m always hearing
about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Yeah, but it-it-it&#146;s my whole life&#151;you come to England.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I can&#146;t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I
can&#146;t leave him. Isn&#146;t&#151;you don&#146;t think there&#146;s any way?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ohh, I don&#146;t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way
into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh no, no, right I shouldn&#146;t have said married. Uh, please
don&#146;t go freaky on me. I didn&#146;t mean it. Well, I didn&#146;t say it; I take it
back!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, don&#146;t. Why don&#146;t we?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Why don&#146;t we what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Get married.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> You are mad!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! I&#146;m not! It&#146;s-it&#146;s-it&#146;s perfect! I mean
it&#146;s better than you just-just moving here, &#145;cause it&#146;s us together
forever, and that&#146;s-that&#146;s what I want.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> We&#146;ve only known each other for six weeks!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who&#146;s-who&#146;s to say? Does that me
we-we can&#146;t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married
and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us.
Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I
mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn&#146;t it?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> My parents are going to be really mad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is that&#151;are you saying yes? Is that yes?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Yes.</p>

<p>(They kiss and hug.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes! We&#146;re getting married?!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh my God! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> We&#146;re getting married!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you
marry me?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Yes.</p>

<p>(He tries to put it on her finger.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ohh, it&#146;s a bit small.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> It was.</p>

<p>(They kiss.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commerical Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway, Joey and Chandler are coming back from the game.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Those were like the best seats ever.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y&#146;know, kinda
like a peace offering.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, that&#146;s very nice. Plus, y&#146;know they were free and
they&#146;re too small.</p>

<p>(He knocks on the girls&#146; door and walks in. Surprise! The girls, obviously using <i>Star
Trek</i> technology, have completely moved everything in both apartments back to their
original positions, all in the time it took for the guys to go to a basketball game. Wow!
Anyhoo, Chandler is stunned, and Joey doesn&#146;t even realise it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head
cut off.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)
(Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I KNOW!!!</p>

<p>(They both sprint to what used to be their apartment.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Open up! Open up! Open up!</p>

<p>(A very angry Monica opens the door with the security chain still on.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We&#146;ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What the hell is going on?!</p>

<p>(It&#146;s Rachel&#146;s turn to open the door.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)
(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don&#146;t feel good about it.</p>

<p>(She goes to close the door, but Chandler puts his foot it in.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We are switching back, right now!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, we&#146;re not! We&#146;re not leaving!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you&#146;re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have
jobs, and as soon as you do, we&#146;re switching it back! There&#146;s nothing you can do
to stop us! Right, Joe?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t want to move again! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t care, this is our apartment! And they stole&#151;you
stole it&#151;our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am
getting it back right now. I&#146;m getting back right now!</p>

<p>(They open the door.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup
offer.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can&#146;t offer anything to us!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let us keep the apartment and&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.</p>

<p>[Time lapse. The guys are entering their apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Totally worth it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That was one good minute!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good night.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good night.</p>

<p>(They both go back into their old rooms and shut the doors. Of course, Chandler has to
close both sections of his door.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the girls apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Men are such idiots.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our
apartment back?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s so funny to think if you&#146;d just done that right after
the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, let-let-let&#146;s pretend that&#146;s not true.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, scarf&#146;s done. (It&#146;s not really a scarf, it&#146;s just a
bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with
them Joey and Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! Come on. Come on.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What-what&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, okay, it&#146;s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.</p>

<p>(The gang is stunned.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Umm, no.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> When, when did&#151;how, how did you&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I mean, we know it&#146;s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right,
so&#133;</p>

<p>(Rachel slowly walks in from her bedroom. She is stunned speechless.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for
Rachel&#146;s reaction.) I think it&#146;s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I&#146;m so happy for
you!</p>

<p>(Seeing Rachel&#146;s apparently okay with this, the rest of the gang jumps up to
congratulate Ross and Emily on their pending nuptials.) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, well, that&#146;s great!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Ross) I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re getting married! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. (They hug again.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at
him.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey&#146;s bedroom, he is asleep and snoring loudly. Chandler enters wondering
who left their engine running.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!
Joey! Joey!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!</p>

<p>(Chandler acts disgusted, but is happy that Joey has stopped snoring. However, just as
he is about to leave, Joey starts snoring again. So to get him to stop, he slams the door
shut, waking Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is getting another cup of coffee.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to
pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when you&#146;re not working here?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> You don&#146;t need to fill these silences.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey,
and Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, that&#146;s like your fourth cup of coffee!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I&#146;m exhausted!
Because Joey started snoring!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He&#146;s in a different room! He&#146;s really that loud?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (proudly) Oh, you should here me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a
sleep clinic!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I told ya, I&#146;m not going to any clinic! I don&#146;t have a
problem, you&#146;re the one with the problem! You should go to a &quot;Quit being a baby
and leave me alone&quot; clinic!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> They don&#146;t have those.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you&#146;ve
just had your first class!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light
sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohhh, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Next time you snore, I&#146;m rolling ya over!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do
it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey guys!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, all right!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p>(Joey starts humming <i>Here Come the Bride</i>.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, the Olympics.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Have you guys picked a date yet?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no, not yet.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I <b>still</b> cannot believe you&#146;re engaged! (Ross looks at her)
Just &#145;cause its happening so fast; not &#145;cause you&#146;re such a loser. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ugh, she&#146;s upstairs <b>not</b> doing the dishes! And I tell ya
something! I&#146;m not doing them this time! I don&#146;t care if those dishes sit in the
sink until they&#146;re all covered with&#151;I&#146;ll do them when I get home!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah&#151;oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in
London&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Already?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but it didn&#146;t fit. Well, luckily there&#146;s a store here that
has one left in her size, but I&#146;m the groom, I&#146;m not supposed to see the
dress&#133; </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;ll pick it up for you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, she&#146;s got you running errands, y&#146;know, picking up
wedding dresses&#133; (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What&#146;s wah-pah?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know, whipped! Wah-pah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s what I did. Wah-pah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You can&#146;t do anything!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is not doing the dishes. She hears someone coming
up the stairs and quickly puts down her magazine and pretends like she&#146;s actually
doing the dishes.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! It&#146;s you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So listen uh, I know you and I haven&#146;t really had a chance to talk
since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know if you were getting married I&#146;d feel, kinda&#133;..
y&#146;know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but
I&#146;m okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, I just wanted to check.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, that&#146;s sweet.</p>

<p>(He goes over to hug her.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You&#146;re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You
just hang in there.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (breaking the hug) Uhh, hang in there?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, no, I didn&#146;t mean, uh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean maybe you didn&#146;t hear about a serious relationship called me
and Joshua?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn&#146;t
realise that had become anything, yet.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has&#151;yeah. Oh no, those
were four <b>great</b> dates. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y&#146;know,
emotionally, mentally, physically&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow, that&#146;s-that&#146;s-that&#146;s incredible.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know isn&#146;t it? It&#146;s like I&#146;m right there with Joshua.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You are right there with Emily. And it&#146;s y&#146;know, it&#146;s

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah? Fine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, y&#146;know, y&#146;know what would make me really happy?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah, no, what&#146;s that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> If like the four of us could all y&#146;know, hang out together. Uh, in
fact Emily&#146;s coming into town this weekend, why don&#146;t you say we all have
dinner? Say, Sunday night?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That would be great!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, all right, it&#146;s a date. (He leaves)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the
raspberry.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (coming back in) Did you say something?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, just singing. (Does a little song.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Beatrice Bridal Shop, Monica and Phoebe are there to pick up Emily&#146;s
dress.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It&#146;s so beautiful!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but y&#146;know, about have of these are gonna end up getting
divorced.</p>

<p><b>The Saleslady:</b> May I help you ladies?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, yes, umm, I&#146;m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.</p>

<p><b>The Saleslady:</b> Yes, what&#146;s the name, please?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Emily Waltham.</p>

<p><b>The Saleslady:</b> Yes! I have it right here. (Phoebe and Monica both gasp at the
dress.) Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) Okay.</p>

<p>[Time lapse. Monica is wearing the dress and starring at herself in the mirror.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&#146;re the most beautiful bride I&#146;ve ever seen.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I am, aren&#146;t I?</p>

<p><b>The Saleslady:</b> Ms. Waltham?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes?</p>

<p><b>The Saleslady:</b> We&#146;re closing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right. (Goes to take off the dress.)</p>

<p><b>The Saleslady:</b> And could I get my ring back?</p>

<p>(She disgustedly takes the ring off and gives it back.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey&#146;s bedroom, he&#146;s snoring again and Chandler is there to roll him
over.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a
surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a
clinic! You&#146;re going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is doing the dishes.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates?
Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Monica is now <b>wearing</b> the dress while doing the dishes and is
making like she is thanking her guests for coming to her wedding. Paging Dr. Crane. Dr.
Fraiser Crane!]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming.
(There&#146;s a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no, let me in!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Can you just hold on for one minute?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, you have to let me in right now!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you alone?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right.</p>

<p>(She goes over and lets Phoebe bounce in wearing her own wedding dress.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is complaining about going to the clinic.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> This sucks! I didn&#146;t know I had to stay up all night before I went to
this stupid sleep clinic! I&#146;m so tired!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s 6:00.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and
Emily, and I think that&#146;s, I think that&#146;s really cool.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, Rach, I think you&#146;re handling that really well.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There&#146;s nothing to
handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn&#146;t for me and Joshua.
Y&#146;know, they&#146;re not gonna get married anyway!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it&#146;s ridiculous! I
mean, they&#146;re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way,
one of them is gonna realise what they&#146;ve done and they&#146;re call the whole thing
off. I&#146;m telling ya, you&#146;re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you&#146;re
dancing at there&#146;s.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, I don&#146;t dance at weddings.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I
look like this&#133; (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind
him and he stops.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey man.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I am&#133; (Looks in his date book.) free!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey and Chandler:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yep!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> In a month?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You mean, you mean 30 days?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> From now? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, that&#146;s great.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place
that her parents got married, but it&#146;s going to be torn down, so&#133; I mean, I-I
know it&#146;s crazy, but everything up &#145;til now has been so crazy, and I don&#146;t
know, this just feels right. Y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (still looking in date book) Hey! That&#146;s the day after I stop
menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn&#146;t mine.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is waiting impatiently for Joshua.]</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> (entering) Hey, Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, sure-sure, yeah,

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I know, I know, it&#146;s-it&#146;s so, it&#146;s so totally like,
&quot;Whoa! Can we do this?&quot; Y&#146;know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right!
Don&#146;t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don&#146;t you think?</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you&#146;re a real special lady, but my divorce
isn&#146;t final yet and, and, and we&#146;ve been on four days, so I&#146;m thinking
&quot;No, but thanks.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (upset) That was a terrible throw!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m not gonna right to you! That&#146;s not real!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look at me! My big concern is what&#146;s real?! (Finally realises) Oh

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I think we are.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They&#146;re
stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, how&#146;d that happen?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because I&#146;m cooler.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, seriously.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well she&#146;s, she&#146;s the kinda girl&#151;Joey was unconscious. </p>

<p>(Joey enters, wearing a mouth guard like boxers wear.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What&#146;s happening?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What is that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it&#146;s gonna
help me not to snore.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? &#145;Cause I don&#146;t think you
have to wear it unless you are!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (takes out the mouth guard) I know I don&#146;t have too! It tastes good.
(Puts it back in.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Plus, you look cool.</p>

<p>(Joey totally agrees with this statement and kicks his feet up.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is putting away the wedding dress, finally.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, how did it go?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I did my best to convince him that I&#146;m not some crazy girl
who is dying to get married&#151;I&#146;m just going through a hard time.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What did he say?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well uh, his answering machine was <b>very</b> understanding. Ugh. I
feel blue.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that
he&#146;s gonna call you again.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, maybe, but I don&#146;t think I even care. I don&#146;t think
he&#146;s the one I&#146;m sad about. Y&#146;know, I know that I said that I am totally
okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don&#146;t think I&#146;m handling
it all that well.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, maybe.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And I-I am just trying to figure out why.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Any luck?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, yeah, y&#146;know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on
again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on
again.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Again. Y&#146;know what? I think we all did.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily&#146;s wedding dress into
Rachel&#146;s room.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,
Ernie&#146;s at 9 o&#146;clock?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, see I-I don&#146;t know if we&#146;re gonna be hungry at three.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Three people. Joshua&#146;s not gonna be there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Noo. Why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, apparently he scares easy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, Rachel, I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&#146;s okay. Sometimes, things don&#146;t work out the way you&#146;d
thought they would.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come here.</p>

<p>(They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don&#146;t you have to go pick up Emily?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! I got my girls.</p>

<p>(He leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe&#146;s lap.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (looks at Monica) Hey, y&#146;know what might cheer you up?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p>[Time lapse, all three girls are now wearing wedding dresses, eating popcorn, drinking
beer, and watching TV.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&#146;know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)
Maybe someday, there will be.</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God! He&#146;s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big
date!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no, Rachel, don&#146;t get it! He can&#146;t see us!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m not gonna marry Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not after this!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she
does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it&#146;s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the
door.)</p>

<p><b>Joshua:</b> I gotta go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that
oughta do it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s bedroom, he is sleeping with Marjorie. All of the sudden,
Marjorie starts talking in her sleep, awakening Chandler. After a little bit, she quiets
back down, and Chandler tries to get back to sleep. There&#146;s a short pause until she
starts screaming, causing Chandler to scream with her. She quickly calms down. This all
wakes up Joey, who comes over wearing the mouth guard, opens the top half of
Chandler&#146;s door, and starts to complain about the noise.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am <b>trying</b> to sleep! (Shrugs to
say, &quot;What&#146;s up with that?&quot;)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are sitting and talking.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has
happened.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know. <b>Ross</b> is getting married.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe is, making people.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Everybody&#146;s doing stuff!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even
know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, not something stupid, something huge.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing
everyday! We could totally do that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why not?! I mean it&#146;s just, it&#146;s just climbing! It&#146;s
just, it&#146;s just steep!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We&#146;re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass
print on Everest!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What-what&#146;s up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We&#146;re gonna climb Mt. Everest!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah baby!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and
y&#146;know you can die. And, you would die!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (dejected) Yeah, well&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We could get that Everest video though.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we could do that without y&#146;know risking our lives at all!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And while we&#146;re down at the video store, you know what else we could
rent? <i>Die Hard</i>! (Chandler&#146;s excited.) Oh, y&#146;know what? I just remembered,
that Everest thing is only available through mail order.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (dejected) Oh, well&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So you guys&#146;ll stay here and hang out with me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeeeeahhhh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But I&#146;ll tell you something. One of these days we&#146;re get off
of our buts and rent <i>Die Hard</i> again!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s apartment, he and Emily are addressing their invitations.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he&#146;s so cheap, he&#146;d never fly to
London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her
some envelopes.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Yeah, they&#146;re fine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

the envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure. Why not?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I don&#146;t think I&#146;d be comfortable with any of my old lovers
there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn&#146;t invite her?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, no-no, y&#146;know I absolutely adore Rachel it&#146;s just that,
well it might be a awkward for you. But it&#146;s absolutely your decision. (Gets up.)

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I knew.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I did.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here&#151;but do you think it would be okay if I asked you
out? Sometime? Maybe?</p>

this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I
was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!</p>

Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are reading a book about things to do
whilst in London.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that
there&#146;s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the
book.) &quot;It&#146;s almost as good as being there.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s better! You can&#146;t go to a museum in your underwear!</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Chandler: </strong>Well, You could, but... probably just the one
time.</p>

<p><strong>Joey: </strong>I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our
hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, hey, museum geeks, party&#146;s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice
lady. There you go. Back to your parent&#146;s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit
and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out!
Here you go. All right.</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Wow, I didn&#146;t know they let you keep chickens and ducks as
pets.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the
wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck
complies.)</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw
one hell of a party.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin&#146; ya. And listen if any of my
friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday&#133;</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. I&#146;ll let you play with my duck.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey&#146;s bedroom, it&#146;s the middle of the night, he&#146;s waking up and
discovers he&#146;s alone in bed.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, (realises he doesn&#146;t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that
the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it&#146;s empty and starts to panic.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it&#146;s continued from earlier. Joey is now waking
Chandler and telling him the news.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (running and banging on Chandler&#146;s door) The stripper stole the
ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper
stole the ring!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (opening the door) What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> The ring is gone!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this&#151;Ah-ha-ha!!
You lost the ring! You&#146;re the worst best man ever!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, this isn&#146;t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night,
everything&#146;s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper&#146;s gone and the ring is
gone!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You slept with the stripper?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Of course!! (Shrugs.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is entering, Monica and Rachel are talking on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi, guys.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe&#146;s way.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I wanted to apologise if I&#151;y&#146;know seemed a tad edgy
yesterday at my shower. Y&#146;know it&#146;s just the hormones, y&#146;know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No we&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hormones.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> &#133;hormones, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That&#146;s great. So how-how
are things going?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good. Y&#146;know&#151;no-no, okay, it&#146;s-it feels like
everything&#146;s been about me lately, so what&#146;s happening with you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to
Ross&#146;s wedding.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It just might be too hard, given the history and all that&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street
and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, h-how is this like that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, let&#146;s see, it&#146;s not. Really, like that. Because, you see
<b>that</b> was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y&#146;know a bunch of
y&#146;know high school crap that nobody really gives y&#146;know&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (starting to cry) I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry, I just thought that&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is trying to figure out what to do.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ugh! I don&#146;t know what I&#146;m going to do! I called the company
that sent and th-they don&#146;t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this
isn&#146;t an emergency, then what is?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey guys!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And
the guys from work had a blast. Y&#146;know, one of them had never been to a bachelor
party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that&#146;s nice!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, right!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for
myself, I might want to get one of those&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and
the clothes on her back were all she had with her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little
squeeze.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride
who has worn it has had a long and happy life.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you might say, it&#146;s a magic ring.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
H-how?! How could this all happen?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I think it all started when you said, &quot;Hey Joey, why
don&#146;t you be my best man.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I&#146;m gonna call the
cops!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, I screwed up, you don&#146;t have to turn me in!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not on you! On the stripper!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they&#146;re gonna look into
it right after they solved all the murders.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, well, we&#146;ll call the company that sent her!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I did that too! They wouldn&#146;t give me her real name or her number.
They said, &quot;If I bothered them again they&#146;d call the police.&quot; I said,
&quot;If you talk to the police, you tell them I&#146;m missing a ring!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there&#146;s
nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her
come to my office?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, that sounds like fun, but we&#146;ve got a ring to find!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are cautiously serving Phoebe some tea.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Here&#146;s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a
step back.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sips it) It&#146;s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of
relief.) Oh, thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m so glad you liked it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that
was <b>definitely</b> one.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, you can&#146;t have the baby here! I mean I haven&#146;t
sterilised it since the guys moved out!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. It&#146;s okay. We&#146;re gonna be okay. Y&#146;know what?
It&#146;s okay. I&#146;m gonna, I&#146;m gonna, I&#146;m gonna boil some water and just
rip up some sheets!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. It&#146;s all right; it&#146;s probably false labour. They said
that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, get the book! The book!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The Bible?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s office, the guys are there waiting to ambush the stripper.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won&#146;t recognise you because, well, why would
she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I&#146;ll
be uh, Mr. Wong.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Diverse.</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Did anybody call for security?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all
turn there backs on her.)</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.)
Hey, Joey?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Where&#146;s my ring? My dead grandmother&#146;s wedding ring? Where is
it? Where is it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Way to be cool, man.</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> What&#146;s he talking about?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?</p>
<b>

<p>The Guys:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!</p>

<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don&#146;t need to
steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys
make that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the guys are now trying to figure out what next to do,
since their plan with the stripper backfired on them.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn&#146;t
take it, and I didn&#146;t take it; and you (Chandler) didn&#146;t take it, then who did?
(The duck quacks.) Shh! We&#146;re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the
same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn&#146;t get it. After a short pause, with the duck
still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is recovering from her false labour.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I still don&#146;t get how you know when it&#146;s false labour.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, do you <b>see</b> any babies?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How do you feel?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I guess. I mean&#133; I don&#146;t know, it&#146;s just, I guess I
know it&#146;s going to be over soon.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, isn&#146;t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. It&#146;s just y&#146;know usually when you&#146;re, when
you&#146;re done with the pregnant thing, y&#146;know, then you get to do the mom thing.
I&#146;m gonna be y&#146;know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Some moms do that.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay that&#146;s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself
into, it&#146;s just that now that they&#146;re in me it&#146;s like, it&#146;s like I
know them y&#146;know, I mean-I mean, it&#146;s just not gonna be easy when these little
babies have to go away.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aww, sweetie, but it&#146;s not like you&#146;re not gonna have
anything. You&#146;re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that&#146;s even
better.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, really. Really, Pheebs, you&#146;re not gonna be the one worrying
about saving for college, or yelling at them when they&#146;re bad, y&#146;know, or
deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won&#146;t calm down. Y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean, you&#146;re the one they&#146;re gonna come to when they wanna
run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And y&#146;know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They are gonna love me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks you guys! Again.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&#146;re the best. Thanks. Oh! </p>
<b>

<p>Monica and Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just kidding. Ahh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Got cha again, you guys are so easy.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Animal Hospital, the guys have taken the duck in to remove the ring. Joey
is pacing around like an expectant father.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> If anything should happen to him&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey! The vet said it&#146;s a simple procedure.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So! Things can go wrong! You don&#146;t know! What if he doesn&#146;t make
it?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He will, Joe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, but what if he doesn&#146;t? He&#146;s such a good duck.</p>

<p>(With that we go into a little flashback about the guys&#146; memories of the duck. The
first one is Joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. Then it&#146;s
Chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and Chandler
reading to him in bed, and him watching <i>Baywatch</i> when all they had was the canoe
and the duck was in a bucket of water. Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck
watching him. He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. Then it&#146;s Chandler
shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls&#146; apartment, Joey revealing their disco
cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then Chandler playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with them,
and it&#146;s concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping it&#146;s wings. And
the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;m so worried about him, y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,
and then does a double-take realising where it&#146;s been.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> H-h-h-how&#146;s the duck?</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> He&#146;s doing just fine, he&#146;s resting now, but you can see
him in a little bit.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, that&#146;s all right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, it&#146;s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let
you down!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, come on, it&#146;s not your fault.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, it is! You wouldn&#146;t have lost the ring, right? Y&#146;know
what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, you should.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now, don&#146;t argue with me&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! Hey! Hey! <b>I</b> get to choose my best man, and I want both you
guys. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are
my&#133; I mean, I&#146;m lucky to have just one good&#133; (They all start getting
emotional.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks man.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so
that they can&#146;t see him cry.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What a baby.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Total wuss!</p>

<p>(They both turn and wipe their eyes.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for the flight to
London and Monica comes running in.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to
get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London,
there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Six-hour trip to London. That&#146;s a lot of Monica.</p>

<p>[Cut to the girls&#146; apartment, Monica is putting things into her purse as Phoebe
and Rachel watch.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,
check! Traveller&#146;s cheques, check! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who are you saying &quot;check&quot; too?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Myself. Y&#146;know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good
thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only
did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! Are you ready yet?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yep! You got the tickets?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! Got &#145;em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!</p>

<p>[Cut to the guys&#146; apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than
enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls&#146; apartment.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You got your passport?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don&#146;t want to lose that.</p>

<p>(Chandler glares at him. At first Joey doesn&#146;t know why, it takes him a little bit
to figure it out.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There it is.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, Monica is telling Phoebe where
everything is.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, if you need the vacuum, it&#146;s in my closet on the left-hand
side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, okay, but Rachel&#146;s gonna be here too, can&#146;t I just ask
her this stuff?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, okay, give that a try!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, with Joey) All right! Let&#146;s do it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Woo-hoo!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, cheerie-o! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> London baby!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, &#145;cause that&#146;s not gonna get annoying.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (louder) London baby!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, y&#146;know what? I was wrong.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, we&#146;re all here! I guess we should get going!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on
your wedding, but I don&#146;t&#151;can&#146;t get up.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I&#146;ll-I&#146;ll come hug you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, have a great wedding!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! (Trots over)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it&#146;s on the
counter in your apartment.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe&#146;s book as Rachel comes in from her
room.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel) So, we&#146;re off.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Have fun!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re not gonna be
there!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So-so come! Why don&#146;t you come?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> To London! Come to London. Please? It&#146;ll mean so much to me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well, I gotta work, I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why-why can&#146;t you take a couple of days off?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because, I can&#146;t! Ross, I told you, no. I can&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is my wedding.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, y&#146;know what? We really are late! Let&#146;s go!
Let&#146;s go! Let&#146;s go!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine. You&#146;ll-you&#146;ll watch it on video when we get back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, with Phoebe&#146;s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go
Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (laughs) Thank you.</p>

<p>(Chandler kneels down with his arms spread waiting for his hug.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, let&#146;s go! Bye, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Bye, Pheebs!</p>

<p>(They all start out, Rachel gives each one a kiss, and says &quot;bye.&quot; In the
hall, Joey says&#133;)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, do you need a hug? You don&#146;t have to bring me anything!</p>

<p>(And with that, television history is made as, for the first time ever, an entire show
moves it&#146;s entire production to an entirely different country to make a single
episode. We get shots of Buckingham Palace, London Bridge, Big Ben, and the <i>London
Marriott</i> as Joey and Chandler exit.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Street in front of the <i>London Marriott</i>, Joey and Chandler exit. Joey is
carrying a video camera and is shooting Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on! Do something!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am, I&#146;m ignoring you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All
right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his &quot;pop-up&quot; map of
London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, what the hell is that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s London, baby! All right, the hotel&#146;s here. (Points to the
map.) Wait. No, we wanna go&#133; No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I&#146;m gonna have to
go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. Listen-listen, we&#146;re not gonna have to walk this way the
entire time are we?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Another street, somewhere along the River Themes, Ross, Emily, and Monica are
walking to where they&#146;re gonna get married. Emily is relating the troubles with the
caterer.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> &#133;and that was all before 10 o&#146;clock. The caterer rang and said
it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned
to say there aren&#146;t any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.
We&#146;re not gonna be&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Well, up yours too!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! No! No! That&#146;s-that&#146;s time-out!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything&#146;s gonna be great, okay? Come on.
Come on.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chicken Kiev?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um-hmm! Doesn&#146;t that sound delicious at the last minute?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, y&#146;know, but something like salmon which would be so much more
elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn&#146;t have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross
pushes her.) So, I can&#146;t wait to see this place you&#146;re getting married!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily&#146;s parents got married
here.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I still can&#146;t believe they&#146;re tearing it down. It really is the
most lovely building you&#146;ll ever see. I mean it&#146;s over&#133; (She stops
suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s nice.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)</p>

<p>[Cut to inside.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What
are we going to do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s all right! Everything&#146;s gonna be all right.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> How&#146;s it gonna be all right?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh, I see that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out
what happened. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> They torn it down a few days early.</p>

<p>[Scene: Westminster Abbey, Joey and Chandler have successfully navigated the streets of
London and are approaching the Abbey.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I&#146;ve ever seen.
Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,
Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think it&#146;s great. It&#146;s great. Y&#146;know, they&#146;re
thinking of changing the name of this place.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really? To what?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> To Put the Camera Away!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, <b>you</b> are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler
towards the Abbey.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is trying to move off of the couch as Rachel
enters.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Oh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, honey! Don&#146;t get up! What do you need?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no. Oh, nothing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I have a wedgie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, that is all you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So-so, what do you want for lunch?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I don&#146;t know. I guess we <b>have</b> to eat.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I do. What&#146;s the matter?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I
shouldn&#146;t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Eh, don&#146;t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love
with was getting married&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting) Still in love with?! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m not in love with Ross!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, I&#146;m going to Ross&#146;s wedding because he is my
ex-boyfriend and that would be <b>really</b> uncomfortable. Not because, I&#146;m still in
love with him! I mean, hey, y&#146;know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y&#146;know?
<b>Clearly</b> I have feelings for him, but feelings don&#146;t mean love! I mean, I still
have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but
that doesn&#146;t mean that-that I&#146;m still in love with him. Y&#146;know? I-I have
sexual feelings for him, but I <b>do</b> love him&#151;Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my&#151;why
didn&#146;t you tell me?!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We thought you knew!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You all know? Does Ross know?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, Ross doesn&#146;t know anything.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I can not believe you didn&#146;t tell me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, because we thought you knew!! It&#146;s so obvious! God, that
would be like telling Monica, &quot;Hey, you like things clean.&quot;</p>

<p>[Scene: A park in London, Joey and Chandler walk up to a souvenir stand.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>The Vendor:</b> So, what are you guys in the market for? We&#146;ve got uh, scarves,
tulip post cards...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on
the front of it.) Yeah. That&#146;s the stuff. What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I don&#146;t have to buy that, &quot;I&#146;m with stupid&quot;
T-shirt anymore.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look, you&#146;re not really gonna buy that are you?
Don&#146;t you think you&#146;ve embarrassed me enough for one day?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I embarrass you? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How can I answer that when I&#146;m pretending I don&#146;t know you?</p>

<p><b>The Vendor:</b> He&#146;s just jealous. You&#146;ll fit right in; all Londoners wear
them!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?</p>

<p><b>The Vendor:</b> (looks around) They&#146;re all tourists.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,
y&#146;know, you&#146;re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you&#146;re gonna make me choose between
you and the hat? I choose the hat.</p>

<p><b>The Vendor:</b> Good choice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, wait. All right, that&#146;s it, okay, I&#146;m out of here. I
am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand
and walks away trying to be cool.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The hotel, Ross&#146;s room, Emily is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Hello?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think
we&#146;ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> We don&#146;t have to.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She said what?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> She said, &quot;If I&#146;m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere
that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents
spent on this wedding? Do you my sister&#146;s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that
people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts
his pants on backwards.) This isn&#146;t right.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I&#146;m sure
they&#146;ll come back when we can do it right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can&#146;t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
(Holds out his pants)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Don&#146;t you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We
have no choice! Anywhere that&#146;s half-decent would&#146;ve be booked months ago, Ross
don&#146;t you understand? This is our wedding I&#146;m talking about.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is
when we&#146;re getting married.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> So what are you saying? It&#146;s now or never?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. I&#146;m saying it&#146;s now. (He starts putting on his pants,
backwards again.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Or?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There&#146;s no &#145;or&#146; in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> It&#146;s not the pants. It&#146;s you that is backwards. And if, and if
you don&#146;t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we
shouldn&#146;t get married at all! (She storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,
wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please&#151;(He catches something important in the
zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is on the couch as Rachel returns carrying a bunch
of shopping bags.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (depressed) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Manhattan does not have enough stores.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, <b>I</b> think I can help you get over him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You can?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And a small piece of chocolate.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some
graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,
the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn&#146;t feel like getting up. Okay,
I&#146;m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you&#146;re going to remember all of
the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I
love Ross, I think he&#146;s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs
it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you&#146;re with Ross
okay and imagine that you&#146;re kissing him. And you&#146;re-you&#146;re running your
hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross
it&#146;s some kind of grease, it&#146;s&#151;uck! Hah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,
and y&#146;know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let&#146;s try
some uh, aversion therapy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So uh, now look at the picture&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, and umm&#133; (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the
head.) </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ow!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, how do you feel now?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I like <b>you</b> less!</p>

still wearing his hat.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey. (He nods at the hat.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no, y&#146;know what? I really shouldn&#146;t have said that you
were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn&#146;t cool. And if it makes you feel any
better, I&#146;ve had a really lousy day.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Me too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Noo!! I&#146;ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the tape Joey made in front of some famous place in London with a rather famous
English-type person.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
</p>

<p><b>Fergie:</b> (Yep, Sarah, the Duchess of York) Okay, so umm, what&#146;s your
friend&#146;s name?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on tape) Oh, Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Fergie:</b> Hi Chandler! (Waves) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s&#133; That&#146;s was&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s Fergie baby!!</p>

<p><b>Fergie:</b> Joey says you don&#146;t really like his hat, but I think it&#146;s
kinda dashing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How did you? How? How?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?
So, I&#146;m in my map and-and&#133;(Ross enters) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) Yes, I did! And <b>you</b> are welcome!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Am I?! And was it <b>your</b> idea to postpone the wedding?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m gonna go to the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey-hey, since you&#146;re the &#145;fix-it&#146; lady, here&#146;s a
pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn&#146;t want to have the wedding at
all?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> She said that?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just
because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God. You&#146;re even dumber than <b>I</b> am!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t know. A month?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the
first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That&#146;s what we
did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect
four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets
thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most
important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that
other stuff was.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were
just doing the flying nun.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sometimes we were.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That was pretty intense huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn&#146;t think that we just went in
there because we were uncomfortable being out here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (glares at him) I hope he did!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the phone rings and Phoebe answers it.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It&#146;s Joey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the&#151;that looks just
like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say &#145;hi!&#146; but then I
figured, he doesn&#146;t care if he looks like you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the
chick and the duck are doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, they&#146;re having a <b>great</b> time with their Aunt Phoebe!
Aunt Rachel hasn&#146;t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Kinda, but I&#146;ve just been having way too much fun.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So you&#146;re not homesick yet?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I don&#146;t think so.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, the seven of us miss you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who&#146;s seven?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&#146;know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahh, the babies miss me?</p>

<p>(There is a knock on Rachel and Phoebe&#146;s door.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, the pizza guy&#146;s here!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? You ordered pizza without me?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. But y&#146;know we were thinking about you, y&#146;know we ordered
the Joey Special.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Two pizzas?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait, well, where did you get it from?! </p>

<p>(Phoebe has already hung up, leaving Joey in the dark. So Joey decides to watch some TV
and turns on a rerun of <i>Cheers</i>, with the theme song playing. At first, he&#146;s
happy, but as the song progresses Joey gets depressed and homesick.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Emily&#146;s planned wedding place, Monica is dragging Emily in.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You&#146;ll see.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.</p>

<p>(At that Ross plugs in some Christmas lights to light the place up.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh God.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y&#146;know fewer
bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little
alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and&#133; (Points to Ross) You
go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But-but, if you don&#146;t love this, we&#146;ll do it in any other place
at any other time. Really, it&#146;s fine, whatever you want.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> It&#146;s perfect.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And, I don&#146;t know, if it starts to rain&#133;</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Well then we&#146;ll get wet. (They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh. And I don&#146;t even have a date.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is in her bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you remember where the duck food is?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, it&#146;s in the guys&#146; apartment under the sink. Why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (enters with a bag packed) Because I&#146;m going to London.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?! What do you mean you&#146;re going to London?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you
don&#146;t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#151;Rachel, you can&#146;t go! Ross loves Emily!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&#146;s not why you&#146;re going! You&#146;re going because you
hope he&#146;s gonna say, &quot;Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British
chippy.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh&#151;Do you think he will?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! Because he&#146;s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if
you go, you&#146;re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y&#146;know,
it&#146;s too late! You missed you&#146;re chance! I&#146;m sorry, I know this must be
really hard, it&#146;s over.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&#146;know what? No. It&#146;s not over until someone says, &quot;I
do.&quot; (Exits)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn&#146;t
stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I&#146;m carrying a litter.</p>

<p><b>Chandler: </b>Joey, it&#146;s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick,
Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.</p>

(No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long
time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks
embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over
inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear

<p>Mrs. Waltham: </b>(Throws her head back in disgust.) Why?!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is
going to be the last time I promise.</p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Waltham: </b>(Slapping the phone into Joey&#146;s chest.) Joey there&#146;s a girl
on the phone for you.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>(Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to
escort her down the aisle.)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>Did you stop Rachel?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>No, but it&#146;s okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>So nothing got ruined?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>No.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>Oh that&#146;s so great! Ohh, so what&#146;s going on now?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>Ah, I&#146;m-I&#146;m walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham
takes her place.) I&#146;m about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night.
(Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her &quot;Hey.&quot; And now
I&#146;m at the front with Ross. It&#146;s Phoebe. (He shows Ross the phone.) He looks
pretty mad. Uh...I&#146;d better go.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks
at Ross and holds the phone above Ross&#146;s shoulder.)</p>

<p>(Chandler escorts Monica down the aisle.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler: </b>What we did last night was....</p>
<b>

<p>Monica: </b>Stupid.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler: </b>Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)</p>
<b>

<p>Monica: </b>What were we thinking?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler: </b>I&#146;m coming over tonight though, right?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica: </b>Oh yeah. Definitely.</p>

<p>(They quickly take their places and Here Comes the Bride Begins to play. Everyone
seated looks back. Emily is being escorted up the aisle by her father. She kisses him on
the cheek and takes her place by Ross&#146;s side.)</p>
<b>

<p>Minister: </b>Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union
of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now
Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s Wedding, continued from last season, the Minister is about to marry
Ross and Emily.]</p>

<p><b>Minister:</b> Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous
union of Ross and Emily. (Time lapse) Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I Ross...</p>

<p><b>Minister:</b> Take thee, Emily...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces.
He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.</p>

<p><b>Minister:</b> (Looking and feeling awkward. he looks towards Emily.) Uhh...Shall I
go on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you
think I should go up there?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Yes, yes, do go on.</p>

<p><b>Minister:</b> I think we&#146;d better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I,
Ross&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I, Ross&#133;</p>

<p><b>Minister:</b> Take thee, <b>EM-I-LY</b>&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Take thee, (Glares at the Minister) <b>Emily</b>. (Chuckles) Like
there&#146;d be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)</p>

<p><b>Minister:</b> As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death
parts us.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts
us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.)</p>

<p><b>Minister:</b> May I have the rings? (He is given the rings) Emily, place this ring
on Ross&#146;s finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. (She jams the ring onto his
finger) Ross, place this ring in Emily&#146;s hand as a symbol of the love that encircles
you forever.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Happy too.</p>

<p><b>Minister:</b> Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great
pleasure to declare them husband and wife.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yay!</p>

<p><b>Minister:</b> You may kiss the bride.</p>

<p>(He goes to kiss her, but she isn&#146;t very receptive of the kiss. She keeps avoiding
him, until Ross finally gets to kiss her on her cheek.)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (To Mr. Geller) This is worse than when he married the lesbian.</p>

<p>(The band starts to play, and the recessional starts. Ross tries to take Emily&#146;s
hand, but she snatches it away from him.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Just keep smiling.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, that went well. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It could&#146;ve been worse, he could&#146;ve shot her.</p>

<p>(Ross and Emily make it to the lobby.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn&#146;t it?</p>

<p>(Emily gives him a forearm shot across the stomach.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The Wedding reception, Ross and Emily are in the bathroom and Emily is yelling
at him. Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are standing outside the doorway.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (Yelling from inside the bathroom) You&#146;ve spoiled everything!
It&#146;s like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How
can you do this to me?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still
get cake right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (exiting the bathroom) That-that-that&#146;s all right, no honey, you take
your time sweetie. I&#146;ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the
gang) She&#146;s just fixing her makeup.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I hate you!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey,
this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else
joins him.)</p>

<p>(Mrs. Waltham&#146;s phone rings and she answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> Yes, Waltham interiors.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller&#146;s
personal physician, Dr. Philange.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> Who?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I&#146;ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine,
uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women&#146;s names are interchangeable,
through-through no fault of his own.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> Oh my God, Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!</p>

<p>(Mrs. Waltham hangs up on her.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hello?</p>

<p>(Cut to Chandler and Monica at the buffet table.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh wow, I hope you don&#146;t take this the wrong way but, I know we
had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I&#146;m just kinda worried about what it might do
to our friendship.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know. How could we have let this happen?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Seven times!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ugh! Well, y&#146;know, we were away&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> In a <b>foreign</b>, romantic country&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I blame London.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So look umm, while we&#146;re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep
doing it right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I don&#146;t see that we have a choice. But, when we&#146;re
back home, we don&#146;t do it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Only here.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;ll meet you there in two minutes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay! </p>

<p>(He throws down his plate and runs to the wine cellar, Monica is about to follow him
but is intercepted by Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (impatiently) Now?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can&#146;t pretend
that didn&#146;t happen can I?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I-I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, what should I do?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave,
but is stopped by Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa, wait, listen, I think I&#146;m just gonna talk to Ross about what
he think it meant.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait. Rachel, no, he&#146;s married. Married! If you don&#146;t realize
that, I can&#146;t help you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, you&#146;re right. You&#146;re right. You can&#146;t help me.</p>

<p>(Cut to Mr. and Mrs. Geller.)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> (walking by) Yes.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there&#146;s no place to sit, I
mean how are you supposed to eat this?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, what&#146;s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak,
he&#146;s eating it with his hands.)</p>

<p>(Cut to Monica and Chandler, Monica is running up to him.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Forget it, that&#146;s off.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> (drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in
minutes&#133;</p>

<p>(Joey walks up to them.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn&#146;t eat meat
until she has the babies!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I figured we&#146;re in another country, so it doesn&#146;t count.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s true.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The man&#146;s got a point.</p>

<p>(Cut to Rachel and Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi. Sorry, things aren&#146;t working out so well.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no! It could be better, but it&#146;s gonna be okay, right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she&#146;s gonna get over this, y&#146;know?
I mean, so you said my name! Y&#146;know you just said it &#145;cause you saw me there, if
you&#146;d have seen a circus freak, you would&#146;ve said, &quot;I take thee circus
freak.&quot; Y&#146;know, it didn&#146;t mean anything, it&#146;s just a mistake. It
didn&#146;t mean anything. Right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! Of course it didn&#146;t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can
understand why Emily would think it meant something, y&#146;know, because-because it was
you&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But it absolutely didn&#146;t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It
didn&#146;t!! It didn&#146;t!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (approaching) Ross, hey, the band&#146;s ready outside for your first
dance with Emily, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band&#146;s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what
the band says&#151;I don&#146;t care about the stupid band!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Y&#146;know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding,
it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, right!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Get the hell out of there, y&#146;know?</p>

<p>(They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realize what she just said and run
over to the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I&#146;m coming in. (He opens
the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, look at that, same thing.</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>London Marriott</i>, Monica and Chandler are walking to her room.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word,
&quot;Yippee!&quot; just ignore me.</p>

<p>(She laughs and opens the door to reveal Rachel sitting on the bed.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, hello Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross said my name. Okay? <b>My</b> name. Ross said my name up there that
obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don&#146;t
believe me, I know I&#146;m right&#151;do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, I want to change. And why-why don&#146;t you go down and get us a
table?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we&#146;ll be down in like five minutes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It&#146;s Phoebe!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yay&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Great&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi, so what happened?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, Ross said my name.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I know, but I don&#146;t think that means anything.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Pheebs, y&#146;know what, let&#146;s look at this objectively all
right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade
he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don&#146;t we go change in my room?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But my clothes are&#151;ohh! (They both leave.)</p>

<p>(Cut to Chandler&#146;s room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and
after seeing that he isn&#146;t, ushers Monica into the room, closes the door, and the
security bar.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, you look&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No time for that!</p>

<p>(They both start to frantically rip each other&#146;s clothes off, but are interrupted
when Joey tries to open the door.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&#146;ve got a girl in here.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No you don&#146;t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, we&#146;re-we&#146;re hanging out in here!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I suppose I&#146;d have to say you!! But, what if we&#146;re
watching a movie in here?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It&#146;s <i>My Giant</i>!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> <i>My Giant</i>? I <b>love</b> that movie!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Emily&#146;s room, Chandler and Monica are still looking for a place
to do the deed.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You really think this is okay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, Ross and Emily aren&#146;t gonna use it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, it&#146;s so beautiful. Ohh! Y&#146;know, I-I don&#146;t know if I
feel right about this.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The <b>room</b>
expects sex. The <b>room</b> would be disappointed if it didn&#146;t get sex. All of the
other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p>(They both run to rip the covers off the bed, but are interrupted by Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Emily?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nope, not under here!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You didn&#146;t find her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I&#146;ve looked everywhere!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you couldn&#146;t have looked everywhere or else you
would&#146;ve found her!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I think you should keep looking!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, for about 30 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Or 45.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! For all I know, she&#146;s trying to find me but couldn&#146;t because
I kept moving around. No, from now on, I&#146;m staying in one place. (He sits down on the
bed.) Right here.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, it&#146;s getting late.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we&#146;re gonna go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ugh, y&#146;know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New
York.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it&#146;s a very large plane.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (disappointed) That&#146;s cool.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But, we&#146;ll stay here with you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really
appreciate this, y&#146;know, but you don&#146;t have to rub my butt.</p>

<p>(Chandler slowly takes his hand away.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Emily&#146;s room, the next morning. Ross is now asleep and has his
head in Monica&#146;s lap and his feet on Chandler&#146;s lap. Monica and Chandler are
both still awake and depressed.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We have to leave for New York in an hour.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know, I&#146;ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound
proof, don&#146;t you think?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We can&#146;t do that that&#146;s insane. I mean &#145;A&#146; he
could wake up and &#145;B&#146; y&#146;know, let&#146;s go for it.</p>

<p>(They both try to slowly extricate themselves from Ross, but there&#146;s a knock on
the door that awakens him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.)
Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> You can forget about Emily, she&#146;s not with us.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> We&#146;ve come for her things.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> She&#146;s in hiding. She&#146;s utterly humiliated. She
doesn&#146;t want to see you ever again.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> We&#146;re very sad that it didn&#146;t work out between you and
Emily, monkey. But, I think you&#146;re absolutely delicious.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Excuse me, I&#146;m standing right here!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> Oh yes, there you are.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys
oh hurry up, get some, there&#146;s a whole cart outside&#133; (Sees the Walthams and
stops.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Goodbye Geller.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are
supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I&#146;m gonna
be at that airport and I hope that she&#146;ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel&#146;s
name, but it didn&#146;t mean anything, Okay? She&#146;s-she&#146;s just a friend and
that&#146;s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That&#146;s all! Now just tell Emily that
I love her and that I can&#146;t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please,
promise me that you&#146;ll tell her that.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> All right, I&#146;ll tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> (As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don&#146;t you ever
go out the bloody window!</p>

<p>[Scene: A 747 somewhere over the North Atlantic, Monica and Chandler are sitting in
first class, depressed.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know, maybe it&#146;s best that we never got to do it again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something)
Y&#146;know, technically we still <b>are</b> over international waters.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I&#146;ll see you there in a
bit?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> &#145;Kay!</p>

<p>(Monica gets up and heads for the bathroom, Chandler turns to watch her go and is
startled to see Joey sitting in Monica&#146;s seat.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Can I ask you something?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uhh, no.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Felicity and I, we&#146;re watching <i>My Giant</i>, and I was thinking,
&quot;I&#146;m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.&quot; Do you think I&#146;m
just wasting my life with this acting thing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y&#146;know, you
think I&#146;ll ever get there?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks man. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But what about how much taller he is than me?</p>

<p>(Time lapse, Chandler is finishing his third little bottle of booze.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I mean, there&#146;s no way I can make myself taller now, y&#146;know? And
who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an
unsuccessful, regular sized man?</p>

<p>(Monica returns.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Monica, wow you&#146;ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Had the beef-tips, huh?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is eating cereal from a bowl she has balanced on
her stomach as Joey, Chandler, and Monica return.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>

<p>(They all hug.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You
had sex! (They&#146;re shocked.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No we didn&#146;t!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know you didn&#146;t, I was talking about Monica.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, I did not have sex.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This pregnancy is throwing me all off.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I&#146;m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, me too!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why would you need to say hi to them, you&#146;ve been feeding them for
four days?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh right, maybe I&#146;ll just go home. </p>

<p>(She grabs her bag and leaves, Joey moves a little quicker to his apartment, leaving
Monica and Chandler alone.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, we certainly are alone.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! Good thing we have that, &#145;Not in New York&#146; rule.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Right. Umm, listen since we&#146;re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just
wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what
with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross&#146;s mother&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, an-anyway, I just&#151;that night meant a lot to me, I guess
I&#146;m just trying to say thanks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. Y&#146;know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn&#146;t
because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me &#145;cause,
you&#146;re really hot! Is that okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) That&#146;s okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And I&#146;m cute too.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And you&#146;re cute too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye. </p>

<p>(After he closes the door, Monica starts to follow him, but thinks better of it and
stops.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) I&#146;m still on London time, does that count?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That counts!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, good! (They start kissing.)</p>

<p>[Scene: An airport in London, Ross is waiting for Emily to show up to go on their
honeymoon and sees Rachel walking past.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach! Rach!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (she stops and turns) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I-I-I&#146;ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not yet.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?</p>

<p><strong>Gate Agent:</strong> (On the P.A.) This is the last call for Flight 1066 to
Athens. The last call.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pretty soon I guess.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I just, I don&#146;t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?
Y&#146;know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she&#146;d actually
show up?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, you&#146;re not an idiot, Ross. You&#146;re a guy very much in love.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Same difference.</p>

<p><strong>Gate Agent:</strong> (On the P.A.) All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to
Athens should now be on board.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I get it! Well, that&#146;s that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, you know what, I think you should go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear
your head, I think it&#146;d be really good.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t know&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be <b>really</b> good for you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I could, yeah, I can do that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can&#146;t, I can&#146;t even believe her! No, y&#146;know what, I am, I
am gonna go!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know, why not?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&#146;know&#151;thanks! (They hug)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, I&#146;ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of
here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well&#133;nah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Wait, what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why don&#146;t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well-well, I don&#146;t know Ross&#151;really?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah, it&#146;ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I
can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Cool!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate
agent.) Here. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay, we&#146;re going. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, wait-wait-wait&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You tell them to wait!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Wait! Wait!</p>

<p>(Ross retrieves his jacket and sees that not only has Emily arrived, but she as seen
Rachel take her place on the plane.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Emily.</p>

<p>(She stares at him and Ross realizes what she&#146;s thinking.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No!
Emily!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Flight 1066 to Athens, Rachel is ordering a drink for Ross and herself.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to
Ross&#146;s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey,
look at that, the airport&#146;s moving. (Realizes that that&#146;s not how it works.)
Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the
captain know that we&#146;re moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's Bathroom, Chandler and Monica are sharing a candlelight
bubble bath while drinking champagne and they clink their glasses.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You look cute in bubbles.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ehh, you're just liquored up.</p>

<p>(They move into kiss but are interrupted by Joey knocking on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!</p>

<p>(Monica quickly dives under the water as Joey enters. He looks a little shocked at what
Chandler's doing.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I've had a very long, hard day.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(Joey turns to leave but stops at the door.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!</p>

<p>(Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about
chicken.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chicken? I could eat some chicken.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey Joe!</p>

<p>(Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a
Coke-(Yelps in </p>

<p>pain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke.</p>

<p>(Joey gives him a thumbs up and heads for the chicken.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are eating breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Mornin' Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this
driver&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, The Wheatsheaf.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bodington's!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Bodington's! Woohoo! (And they all high-five each other.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat&#151;I don't want to talk about it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Ross, Bodington's!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! (They high-five.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That was good beer.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know, I'd <b>walk</b> back to London for another frosty one of those bad
boys.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Later! (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch)
she should be here by now.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I did <b>not</b> abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the
airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I <b>had</b> to do! She's my wife!
Rachel is my wife! Y'know&#151;<b>Emily</b>! Emily, is my wife! Man, what <b>is</b> that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So you still hadn't heard from Emily?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, not since I lost her at the airport.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can't believe she can out run you man!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> <b>HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!!</b> (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's
outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think <b>you</b> can be beat
me? Let's go! Outside!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met
the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, what? That's it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, you're the best.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the
door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem,
red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That
oughta get her talking to me again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.</p>

<p>(Ross bangs his fists together to tell Chandler off, like what was learned last season.
Read about it <a href="http://thecfsi.com/season4/405jng.htm#rossthng">here</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I
couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up
to me all the time going, &quot;Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?&quot; I mean, it was
sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why,
because I make very bad decisions.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that's not true.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> London is stupid! Stupid!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now
on you make all of my decisions for me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh&#133; No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having
that kind of power and control over someone's life.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'll do it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That's fine. So Monica, <b>you</b> are now in control of my love life.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I gotta go to work.</p>

<p>(He gets up and gives Monica a rather passionate kiss as Rachel and Phoebe look on in
amazement. After the kiss ends, Chandler suddenly realizes what he just did, so he decides
to do something rather rash.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back. </p>

<p>(He goes over and gives Rachel the same treatment he gave Monica, only Rachel is
shocked.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always
a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Chandler and Joey are there looking at pictures
from the trip to London.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you
at the reception.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't&#151;I still can't believe
it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, sweetie, by the edges.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of
the pictures)&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> &#133;I mean it's my fault.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I
know that wasn't about me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice
that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to
listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at
another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? <b>That</b> is the guy you flirted with at
the counter that time.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your
decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us
at the Tower of London.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we <b>all</b> are! Yeah, there's Ross and
Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't
watch.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much
haven't we?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever
get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p>(Rachel returns.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date
tomorrow night.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well&#133;</p>

<p>(Gunther goes up to the guy and holds a sign that reads, &quot;We reserve the right to
refuse service to anyone.&quot;)</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> (To the guy) Get out!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters to find Monica waiting patiently for him.
He closes the door and they start kissing.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What took you so long?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, good. </p>

<p>(They start kissing and turn around so that Chandler is facing the door. And Chandler
sees Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey walk in and quickly ends the kiss with Monica.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses
her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her
and kisses her.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That's not European!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it felt French.</p>

<p>(Joey is intrigued.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, Rachel is returning from her date with
Dave.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, I really had a good time!</p>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?</p>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this.
Umm, okay, just hold on a second.</p>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Okay, yeah!</p>

<p>(She enters the apartment, leaving Dave in the hallway, to find Ross sitting on the
couch with a big box.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She's doing her laundry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What's that? (Points to the box.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for
each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, honey that's awful.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go
wander out in the rain for a while.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But, it's not raining.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can't catch a break!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right
here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All
right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!</p>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just
really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know
things seem so bad right now.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped
some socks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the
dropped socks.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you
want to fall <b>into</b> the trap?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! <b>You</b> did not drop any socks!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you
listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What
the hell were you trying to do?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted&#133;tell him y'know,
that I'm still in love with him.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Gasps) What?!! You <b>cannot</b> tell him that!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I make the decisions, and I say no.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,
you're fired.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You can't fire me. <b>I</b> make <b>your</b> decisions and I say,
&quot;I'm <b>not</b> fired!&quot; Ha!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well&#133; (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and
throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the
door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel locked the door.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway, continued from earlier. Monica is still locked out.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!</p>

<p>[Cut to inside the apartment, Ross decides to let Monica in and goes over and opens the
door in mid-pound.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I really need to talk to you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, then talk!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted
to do?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What thing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a
really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows
who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I
gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My
God, think of the massacre.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm gonna do it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you
tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.
Because I bet you, you can't.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But I&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Please!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, fine.</p>

<p>(There's a loud bang on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, I'm in!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters.]</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, okay, Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to
go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all
take a little trip together!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central
Park!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (excited) <b>Central</b>&#133;(not so excited) Park!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, all of us! All day!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we
gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? &quot;Well, it's right by my house, all
right!&quot; </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park
idea. (Gets up to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr.
Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European
thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable
and I just&#151;y'know&#151;stop it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.) </p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, and Joey are there as Ross enters with
Phoebe.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Phoebe!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, woo!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, woo! Hi.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little&#133; Y'know, it
didn't have any&#133; It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we
would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Mine!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait! It was <b>my</b> plan.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooo, <b>I</b> said we needed a new plan.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And, <b>I</b> came up with Atlantic City.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> <b>Which</b>, is the new plan!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!</p>

<p>(They all go pack except for Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on Rach, let's go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone
that you love them and not have them say it back?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I-I don't care.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What 'cha readin'?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The paper.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, what's it about?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Events from around the globe.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to
talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're
wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say
it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.</p>

<p>(Ross is stunned.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow. Umm&#133; Huh&#133; I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.</p>

<p>(Rachel starts laughing hysterically.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why are you laughing?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's
ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and
it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?
And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like,
&quot;You are such an idiot!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, well I <b>am</b> married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife
since the wedding.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where
my wife is. (Laughs) &quot;Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?&quot; Don't know! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you
just forget that I told you this?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That is what the thing is.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that
just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always
great when someone tells you they love you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No thank you for&#133; Thank you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is about ready to leave for Atlantic City.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, let's go!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Atlantic City!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for
rolling bones! </p>

<p>(They high-five and howl, but Phoebe suddenly stops and the guys gasp and retreat in
shock.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! You're water broke!</p>

<p><b>The Guys:</b> Ohh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, they are taking Phoebe to the hospital but
Chandler and Monica hold back.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.</p>

<p>(They both kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel
every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you know anything about women?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's all right. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (They kiss again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hospital, Phoebe is arriving with Ross, Joey, and Rachel in tow.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to the nurse) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of
me.</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> Okay. Have you started having contractions?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> Well&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's all right.</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> Now, which of you is the father? (Points to Joey and Ross)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.</p>

<p><b>Nurse:</b> (not sure what to do with that) Okay&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I am <b>so</b> gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to
look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see
you. Please don't hurt me! </p>

<p>(Monica and Chandler come running in.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!</p>

<p>(There's a pause as they figure out what to say.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's right.</p>

<p>(Both Rachel and Ross stare at her for a moment.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You-you're not wearing a jacket.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh man! I did it again!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (standing up) Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. (As
she is talking Joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) And then my mom wants to
know-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I gotta get the before shot!</p>

<p>(She shakes her head no.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The delivery room, Rachel and Ross are entering.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your
doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, she's so stupid!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your
vagina!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, he's head of the department.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right&#151;Ooh! Oh dead God, save me! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm having my first contraction!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, it's not bad.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and
aaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! You okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, something hurts!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.</p>

<p>(The doctor, Dr. Harad, enters.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I
want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time.
I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because
everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie. (Exits)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's what it sounded like.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right&#133;</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> (To Phoebe) Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna
be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month,
they give you 2% financing.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>[Scene: The waiting room, Monica and Joey are sitting there.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates
with two unbelievably cute nurses.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> They're male nurses.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Not in my head.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think
so.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling
me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on,
give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, why don't you give <b>me</b> something that would be a good reason
and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still
here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some <i>Jell-O</i>
with them.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for <i>Jell-O</i>&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, how do you make <b>that</b> dirty?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his
fingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad&#133;</p>

<p>[Scene: The delivery room, Chandler, Frank, and Ross are with Phoebe.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the <i>USA
Today</i> and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you
were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies&#133; (Throws the paper away to
reveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of <i>Playboy Magazine</i>.) Check it
out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now
let's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera
in it.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either&#151;Ooh,
yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that
was it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really? Male nurses?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I was bummed too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So they're going on dates? When?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I think Saturday&#151;(groans in pain again).</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> (To Phoebe) What's with him?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I
think he's just trying to steal my thunder.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> (entering) Okay!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that
another doctor?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right.</p>

<p>(Dr. Harad exits.)</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> It's not <b>that</b> weird, is it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's <b>very</b> weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm
y'know, dilatedamundo!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> To be fair, he doesn&#146;t seem to be impersonating Fonzie&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just
get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Again, it's not that he&#133;</p>

<p>(Phoebe fakes pain to get Ross looking for another doctor.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The waiting room, Chandler is looking for Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told
me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're
goofin' around.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out
of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I <b>will</b> go out with him.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fine! Maybe I will too!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look
what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a
wheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The delivery room, Ross has returned with another doctor. This one, is well,
younger.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or
any of the <i>Happy Days</i> gang.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi! And you're going into what grade?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Oberman:</b> Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you
see, I-I graduated early&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that
I'd be needing a grown up doctor. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Oberman:</b> Oh no, I'm fully qualified to&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having
babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!</p>

<p>(He runs out and Frank watches him go.)</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Oh cool! You made him cry!</p>

<p>[Scene: Another hospital room, Joey has now been admitted and his doctor is about to
break the bad news to him, Monica, and Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Joey's Doctor:</b> Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm, well, what else could it be?</p>

<p><b>Joey's Doctor:</b> It's kidney stones.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Or?</p>

<p><b>Joey's Doctor:</b> Kidney stones!</p>

<p>[Scene: The delivery room, Dr. Harad is back and checking on Phoebe.]</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are
very, very lucky.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They are. Why?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Happy birthday!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. (Phoebe nods in agreement as he
leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific
thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know, it is.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Can I tell you a little secret?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The delivery room, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you <b>know</b> you
cannot keep one of these babies!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep <b>all</b>
of their children!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're
y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an
opportunity just because I didn't <b>ask</b>! Y'know?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, just ask him!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Me?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <b>I</b> can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that
would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Forget it! I am <b>not</b> gonna ask Frank to give you one of his
kids!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You're right. </p>

<p>(There's an awkward silence then suddenly Phoebe gets an idea.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Tell him it's for you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's room, his doctor, Chandler, and Monica are there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Feeling a little better sweetie?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Me too.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?</p>

<p><b>Joey's Doctor:</b> Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up
the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we
can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up,
up is not an option&#151;what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are
you crazy?!</p>

<p>[Scene: The delivery room, Rachel and Frank are there.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Rachel) So did you ask him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> (laughing) Oh Fonzie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know who I always liked? Mork.</p>

<p>(Dr. Harad drops what he's doing and stares at her.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but umm&#133; Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't
hurt, right?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Yeah, that's right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering with Chandler) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Phoebe) How are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, doctor says any minute now.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me
a favor and like, like hold them in?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to
do.</p>

<p>(A male nurse enters.)</p>

<p><strong>Male</strong> <b>Nurse:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><strong>Male</strong> <b>Nurse:</b> Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be
going out with on Saturday. (Mouths &quot;He's yours.&quot; to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.</p>

<p><b>Dan:</b> Nice to meet you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello Dan! I'm <b>really</b> looking forward to Saturday night! Really,
really!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Dan:</b> Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Dan:</b> <b>And</b> it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
(Retreats in defeat.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?</p>

<p><b>Dan:</b> Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, great!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?</p>

<p><b>Delivery Room <b>Nurse:</b></b> No.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right. Very good.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey's room, who's going throw his own contractions. Plus, he has Ross in a

<p><b>Ross:</b> Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.</p>

<p>(Joey starts breathing hard)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back and
forth, taking Ross with him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I do too! I do too!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Argh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Argh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Argh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Argh!</p>

<p>[Scene: The waiting room, Frank is on the phone as Rachel approaches.]</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! (To Rachel) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be
here by now!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, honey, don&#146;t worry. She's gonna make it on time.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> (laughs) Not to me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, fair enough.</p>

<p>[Scene: The delivery room, later on, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, and Frank are there as
Dr. Harad is checking out Phoebe.]</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies.
All right, I want only the father in here please.</p>

<p>(They all kiss her and wish her luck.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye Dan!</p>

<p><b>Dan:</b> Uh, bye Monica.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye, momi-moo.</p>

<p>(Everyone except Frank leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What is that?</p>

<p>(Dan turns on the TV and the <i>Happy Days</i> theme song comes on.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right,
are you ready? It's time to start pushing.</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey's room, his doctor and Ross are there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey's Doctor:</b> Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. (Joey makes a face like
he is trying to pee.) Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's <b>almost</b> time to try peeing.
(Points at the bottle Joey is to pee into.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the delivery room.]</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah,
here we go!</p>

<p><b>Dan:</b> I see the head.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yes, it has a head! </p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> All right. Keep pushing! Come on!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's
somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> All right. Here's your first baby.</p>

<p>[Cut to the waiting room, a triumphant Frank rushes in.]</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Frank Jr. Jr.!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, how does he look? How does he look?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> So gross! (He runs back to the delivery room.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the delivery room, Phoebe is about to give birth to the middle kid.]</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> Okay. You ready to push again?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I already had a baby. Leave me alone.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!</p>

<p>(Phoebe screams in pain, and Frank screams with her.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the waiting room, a twice triumphant Frank returns.]</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't
believe I have two-two children. How scary is that? (He returns to the delivery room.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the delivery room, Phoebe is at it for the last time.]</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler!
Come on!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Harad:</b> All right, he's coming. He's coming!</p>

<p>(They both stare at the newborn.)</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Hey, where's his thing?</p>

<p>[Cut to the waiting room, a thrice triumphant Frank returns again.]</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Chandler's a girl!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh God, kindergarten flashback.</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it
was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, keep saying it!</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> (running in from the elevator) Am I too late?!</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and
30 toes.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> We have our babies?</p>

<p><b>Frank:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> (Starting to cry) Oh, we have our babies.</p>

<p>(They hug. And quickly that hug turns into a heated make out session, right there on
the waiting room couch. Chandler, Rachel, and Monica quickly make their exits.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's room, he is recovering from his birth.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You did it, man.</p>

<p><b>Joey's Doctor:</b> Would you like to see them? (He hands Joey a little jar.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on
their faces.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A hallway, Monica and Dan are talking.]</p>

<p><b>Dan:</b> So, I'll call you tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Great!</p>

<p>(Dan leaves as Chandler enters.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof
around with him.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around
in the dictionary&#133; Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who
care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to,
y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am <b>so</b> bad at this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think you're better than you think you are.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really? Okay, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting) Know when to stop.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They
kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't
do the dance.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Right!</p>

<p>[Scene: The delivery room, everyone except Rachel is there. Phoebe, Monica, and Ross
are holding the babies.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think you're my favorite.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Which one do you have?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't care.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to
tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, umm, no honey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second
alone with the babies.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>(They hand her the babies and leave them alone.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that
little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they
were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and
see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister
has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little
high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.)
Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The delivery room, everyone is hanging out with Phoebe. Frank, Alice, and the
kids aren't there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So does it really hurt as bad as they say?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. You won't be able to take it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they
gonna name her?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They're gonna call her Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Works on you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel has just gotten home and is going through the mail.
She finds something that's Monica's and goes over and knocks on her closed bedroom door.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you. </p>

<p>(Rachel enters.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in
horror.) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was
taking a nap.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Since when do take naps in <b>that</b> position. Oh God Monica, tell me
you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work!
Ha!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks
like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh-huh, that one!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm
just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock on
the door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm&#133; (Rachel opens the door.) It's
just Joey and Ross.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why aren't you guys at the movie?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us
out!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping
that someone will help him get in touch with her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy,
old twit!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross! Way to suck up to the family.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica
is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all
here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross, and Monica are
eating breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering, wearing a tux) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Vomit tux? Who vomited on&#151;y'know what, what you up to Joe?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as
co-host!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh that's great!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the
kind of math Joey likes to do!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ugh, PBS!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What's wrong with PBS?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ugh, what's <b>right</b> with them?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why don&#146;t you like PBS, Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this
really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I
wrote to <i>Sesame Street</i>, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one
ever wrote back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.
I didn't have keys!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed.
Like-like you did with the babies.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally
selfish.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother?
Talk about selfish!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What-what are you talking about?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel
really good right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. So?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It made <b>you</b> feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds, sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, may I ask for one example?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, it's&#133; Y'know there's&#151;no you may not!</p>

<p>(They are standing on either side of Chandler as they discuss the point. Chandler,
meanwhile, is disgusted with the whole argument.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's because all people are selfish.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Are you calling me selfish?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to
burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on
Santa Clause right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil
genius.</p>

<p>(Ross's phone rings and he answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Hello.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (on phone from London) Hello, Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and
hands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily)
Hi!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling!
I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk
to me!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Really? About what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really
miss you.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to the gang, whispering) She's talking.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> (subdued) Yay! (He motions for them to keep quiet, including Chandler who
is still holding the lamp Ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to Emily in
private.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That he doesn't exist.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don&#146;t think he's up to meeting everyone
yet.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever
had!</p>

<p>(Chandler is quite pleased with that statement.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And <b>you</b>, you lucky
dog!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's great!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> In London!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She wants me to move to London.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What-what-what are you gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London
with Ben.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another
country so you can patch things up with your new wife.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It could happen.</p>

<p>[Scene: Unitel Video, Studio 55, Joey's telethon, he is being shown around by the stage
director.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!</p>

<p><b>Stage Director:</b> This will be your phone.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.</p>

<p><b>Stage Director:</b> No you answer it and take pledges.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But I'm the host!</p>

<p><b>Stage Director:</b> No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.</p>

<p><b>Stage Director:</b> Well, here's your phone doctor. (She walks away.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are there.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy
that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his
front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three
children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sure!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret
boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler! (Pause) Is he?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret
boyfriend.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why?! I mean if this guy was <b>me</b> and it was <b>me</b> who had
learned that it was <b>me</b> who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He
jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, he's on the phone with Emily.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London
without Ben.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I understand that would be difficult.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, would you <b>please</b> consider moving here? I mean you were gonna
move here anyway, why can't you just do that?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I don't know, it's just&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh-okay, but-but <b>I</b> know, that even though I've been a-a complete
idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so
we can work this out.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, did you just say all right?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I did. Now I'm the idiot.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna
be like-like-like two idiots in love!</p>

<p>(She laughs.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, tell me.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that
altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know. I am, I am so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching
our plane with her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Again, very sorry.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just
thinking of you being in the same room as her!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Emily, there is <b>nothing</b> between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh that is so great! That's&#133;</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (interrupting him) As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is telling Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler about Emily's
ultimatum.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh-ohh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Great!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! You can't&#151;what did you tell her?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed
to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm <b>actually</b> asking you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best
friends.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's true!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut
her out of your life.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <b>That's</b> true!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, you cannot.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)</p>

<p>(The phone rings.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (answering it) Hello.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Hey Mon!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV
and that's good exposure. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman
next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, there he is! There he is!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the chick and the duck are watching Emeril Live, a cooking
show.]</p>

<p><b>Emeril:</b> (on TV.) Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who
cares, y'know? Now I got the legs&#133;</p>

<p>(Chandler enters and sees what they're watching, panics, and runs to turn off the TV.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How many times have I told you guys, you <b>never</b> watch the
cooking channel!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hi Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up
caterpillars. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> <i>William Sonoma</i>, fall catalog, Page 27.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's
gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, so?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best
you'd ever had.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy
dance.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What's your point?</p>

<p>[Scene: The Telethon, Joey's phone rings and he answers it.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (in a bored voice) PBS telethon.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee
is happy and I am definitely not.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)</p>

<p><b>Stage Director:</b> Back on in 30 seconds people!</p>

<p>(Joey gets up and moves to the other end of his row to talk to the guy sitting there.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?</p>

<p><b>PBS Volunteer:</b> Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on man! You've been here all day!</p>

<p><b>PBS Volunteer:</b> Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?</p>

<p><b>Stage Director:</b> We're on in 3, 2, (points to Gary Collins.)</p>

<p><b>Gary Collins:</b> Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the
performance of <i>Cirque Du Soleil</i>,<i> </i>(As he is speaking, Joey and the volunteer
getting into a shoving match.) and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming,
it's very simple. All you have to do (Joey is knocked down.) is call in your pledge and at
that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like
to&#133; (Just as the volunteer sits down, Joey pulls him to the ground.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Phoebe are cooking, Chandler is reading a
magazine.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is <b>too</b>
difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and
starts shaking a&#133;)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision
with a toy!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, it's not a toy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose
one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before
I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got
nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then.
Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the
answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the
answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex
tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Telethon, Joey answers his ringing phone.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone) Hi Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <b>I</b> would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what <i>Sesame Street</i> did to
ya?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to
lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not <b>happy</b> about it. So there, a selfless good deed.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And you don't a little good about donating the money?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.</p>

<p><b>Gary Collins:</b> (on TV.) It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total!
Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers&#133;(He
walks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed
volunteers, (Joey stands up.) Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV!
Oh that makes me feel&#151;Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore
it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, later that day. Monica is coming out of the bathroom
carrying her cleaning gear.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's
something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Keep talking.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which
wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH&#133;MY&#133;GOD.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me
again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into
his arms.) Oh my&#133; When is Joey gonna be home?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to
take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But, I just cleaned the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. (She takes them off.)</p>

<p>(He carries her over to the door and opens it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, let's show them how it's done.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(He starts to carry her into the hallway but hits her head on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ow!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know that wasn't part of it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know!</p>

<p>(He carries her into the hall.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is prying at the Magic 8 Ball with a screwdriver as
there's a knock on his door which he goes to answer.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> For what?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Like what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your
help.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you
need somebody to talk to&#133; Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give
it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she
wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna <b>have</b> to
try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on
answer it! It's driving me crazy!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look
umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.
(Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what
she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not
knowing what's going on.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, ??????? is playing, as Chandler peaks his head out of the storage
closet and sneaks back to his seat and pretends he's reading something. Then a short while
later Monica pokes her head out of the closet and sneaks back to her seat and sits down,
pretending as if nothing has happened.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Never done that before.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, 3:02 A.M., Chandler is up. There's a knock on the door and
Chandler answers it.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (quietly) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)</p>

<p>(Joey enters and Chandler pushes her away.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Monica? What time is it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But it's dark out.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9
looks like.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the
bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm <b>really</b> getting tired of sneaking around.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a
chef thing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in
Jersey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait! What about Joey?</p>

<p>(Chandler opens the bathroom door to reveal Joey passed out on the toilet with a
toothbrush in his mouth.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are eating
breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm
going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference
could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people
to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, she's out shopping.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Damn!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see
Rachel anymore?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the &quot;I get to see my
wife,&quot; part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig
of <i>Pepto Bismol</i>.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?
How is that even gonna work?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I have no idea. I mean&#133; But-but I assure you I will figure it out.</p>

<p>(They all reflect briefly on what was said.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Doesn&#146;t seem like it's going to work, I mean&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hi, guys!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We're flipping Monica's mattress.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and <b>then</b> we flip it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah that's better than my way.</p>

<p>(They all agree and head to Monica's room.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! I know.</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's bedroom, Chandler is trying to listen through the door.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Chandler) Can you hear anything?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes, somebody just said, &quot;Can you hear anything?&quot;</p>

<p>(Joey is bent over at the waist and is looking for something under Monica's bed.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke
up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at
the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, <i>Madlibs</i>, mine! (Grabs it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Condoms?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! <b>We</b> may have to
repopulate the Earth.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And condoms are the way to do that?</p>

<p>[Cut to the living room.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to
Emily&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Le Poo's still alive?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for
nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh
my God.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's Le Poo.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.</p>

<p>[Scene: Atlantic City, New Jersey, Chandler and Monica are about to start their weekend
of sex, sex, nothing but sex.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, you should live with Joey, <i>Roll-os</i> everywhere.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back. </p>

<p>(Goes to the bathroom and Chandler turns on the TV and finds a high-speed police
chase.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!</p>

<p>(Monica returns, carrying a glass.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We're switching rooms.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us
glasses!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't
change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on
sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's
feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is trying to tell Rachel about Emily's ultimatum again.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's
this one thing&#133; Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't
looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross
notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're nose is bleeding!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her
nose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head
back.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm&#133; (Rachel blows her nose.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sorry. Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Monica's weekend, a hotel clerk is showing them their new room.]</p>

<p><b>Hotel Clerk:</b> I think you'll find this room more to your liking.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)</p>

<p><b>Hotel Clerk:</b> (watching the chase) They say he's only got half a tank left.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We're switching rooms again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What? Why?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.</p>

<p><b>Hotel Clerk:</b> Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a
second?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (turning to face her) Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna
let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you
just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Monica and Chandler have changed rooms yet again.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, <b>this</b> one I like!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is
regularly scheduled programming!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire
weekend like this?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage
to 10 different rooms?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany
to Canada on a half a tank of gas!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do not speak ill of the dead.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it,
what is the matter with you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez,
relax mom.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What did you say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I said, &quot;Geez, relax Monnnnn.&quot;</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is reading a magazine and has two tissues stuck up
her nose in an attempt to stop the bleeding and as she hears Ross enter, she quickly hides
her face behind the magazine and removes the tissues.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now
and I really, I just have to get it out.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, what's up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my
marriage?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she
wants&#133; </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> &#133;is for me not to see you anymore.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause)
(Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want
my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make <b>this</b> marriage work. I have too. But
the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That <b>is</b> good news, Ross! I think that's
the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a
little bit easier for you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Storming out!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel, this is your apartment.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is returning from his disastrous weekend. He
throws his bag down and sits down on one of the leather chairs, but he sits on something
and picks it up and throws it away.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Damn <i>Rollos</i>!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, you're back!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How was your conference?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the
entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another <i>Rollo</i>)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, you're back too!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, how was your chef thing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't
appreciate really good food.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then
made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica. (Follows her out.)</p>

<p>[In the hall.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my
half.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, fine, $300.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> 300 dollars?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Urghh!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself
without twenties and <b>you</b> always have lots!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is drinking some <i>Alka-Seltzer</i>. The rest of the gang,
minus Rachel is there as well.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I
don't know what to do.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You want my advice?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes! Please!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You're not gonna like it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You got married to fast.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's not advice!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I told ya.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler and <b>Phoebe:</b> </b>Yeah, me either.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Maybe I could do it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi, Rach.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but
y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just <b>love</b> not to talk about
it. All right?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right
back there. (Points over his shoulder.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That's not Ross!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, you're not Kip!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, that poor bastard.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up
they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay
his friend and what happened? He got phased out!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You're not gonna be phased out!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.
(To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before
someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ehh!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right
out.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an
eyelash curler in your room.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes that was mine.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes that would have made more sense.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look,
I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were
you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is sitting on couch and Rachel is getting some coffee.
Phoebe keeps turning her head from to keep from looking at Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole
lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come where?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're
the best ones.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, but try and get Joey too.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his
back.) Forever.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. <b>I'm</b> the
one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Ross&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their
sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey
at <i>Burger King</i>. So is, is that better?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you
do?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can't believe this is happening.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I am so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know that too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry
to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is doing a crossword puzzle.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I just came over to drop off&#133;nothing. So that weekend kinda
sucked, huh?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, it did.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, I guess this is over.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why, exactly?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because of the weekend, we had a fight.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with
someone you'd never be with anyone longer than&#151;Ohhh! (They both realize something
there.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, this isn't over?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and
move on! It's nothing to freak out about.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really? Okay. Great!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (stops her) We're in a relationship?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm afraid so.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(They kiss.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler are there as Phoebe
enters.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.</p>

<p>(Joey thinks that sounds familiar, but dismisses the thought.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)</p>

<p>(Joey puts two and two together.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag
Joey into Monica's room.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!</p>

<p>(Chandler pushes him through the door and Monica closes it behind them.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica's room, Chandler tackles Joey onto her bed and tries to cover his
mouth.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How?! When?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It happened in London.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> <b>IN LONDON!!!</p>
</b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a
big deal out of it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! </p>

<p>(They both grab him and stop him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no-no-no! You can't!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Just promise you won't tell.</p>

<p>(Joey thinks it over.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's <b>great</b>, but&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know, it's great!</p>

<p>(She goes over and kisses Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Aww, I don't want to see that!</p>

<p>[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to
take Joey!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang, minus Ross are playing <i>Madlibs</i>. Phoebe is
reading hers.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if
you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, &quot;Hi, Phoebe!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Count for what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Count in our heads as-as good <i>Madlibs</i>.</p>

<p>(They putting their notepads down and get up to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I guess I'm done.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fun's over!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means
something!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I think I'm gonna take-off.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and
close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Monica and Chandler are making out on one of the chairs.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living
under my roof!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, just because I <b>know</b> about you two, doesn't mean I like
looking at it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his
room.) And I'm also sorry if <b>sometimes</b> I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I
have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's
nothing to know about.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler and <b>Monica:</b> </b>Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p>(They wait for Joey to go into his room and close the door and then start making out
again.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (from the bedroom) I can hear that!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) Rachel's at work.</p>

<p>(They both go to her apartment.)</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can still hear you!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are there as Phoebe enters carrying a
large box.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, what's that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my
grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have
heirlooms for crying out loud.</p>

<p>(She puts her leg up on the chair and removes this huge knife from her boot to open the
box with. The guys are shocked at the knife's existence.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a
fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! <b>Why</b> would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but
at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers
bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.)
That didn't happen, I made that up!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How come? Everybody else does.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> You can't.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's&#151;Emily thinks we should get all
new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> I'll take it all.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and <b>get</b> her to New York,
I'm sure everything will be fine.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> After what <b>I</b> did? Can you blame her?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said
someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.</p>

<p>(Ross suddenly gets up and heads for the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's
furniture has got Rachel coodies?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Now calm down Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see
Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's
happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you
cool with that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Storage Room in the basement of Monica and Rachel's building, Monica and
Rachel are looking for something.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please
hurry up honey! Please? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait
until I find the little waffle iron.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I want the little round waffles.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the
can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is
underneath the can of poison?</p>

<p>(The single light flickers and goes out. Leaving the room in total darkness.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!</p>

<p>(She starts to run out but is stopped by a figure looming out of the darkness carrying
a pick axe.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Arghhhh!!!!!!</p>

<p>(They both start screaming at the top of their lungs.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!</p>

<p>(Rachel grabs the bug bomb, activates it, throws it at the figure, and they both run
out through the fog.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are there.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'll take it!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That might work! (She gives him the coat.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right,
what do you think?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great.
Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What's the matter Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and
it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh
new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on
one side and Columbia on the other.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.)
Which is great! I love to ride that rail!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you're really okay with this?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get
so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.
We should get them together and make a continuum.</p>

<p>(Ross exits.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him
again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!</p>

<p>(Monica and Rachel enter breathless.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You guys! You guys!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy
man!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a
bigfoot or a <b>yeti</b> or something!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his
yeti ass!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you fogged Danny.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Please! We did <b>not</b> fog Danny! Who's Danny?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this
four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we
fog!</p>

<p>[Scene: Their Building, Monica and Rachel are going to apologize to Danny. Rachel
knocks on his door, which he opens and he has this really bushy beard and long hair.
Picture Paul Bunyan.]</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! You might not remember us, but <b>we</b> are the girls that fogged
you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Okay. </p>

<p>(He closes the door. Rachel's not happy with that and knocks again. He opens the door.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't <b>mean</b> to fog you, we thought
you were like a yeti or something.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(He closes the door again. Once again, Rachel knocks (harder this time) and he answers
it.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Yesss?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think <b>we</b> can accept your
acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't <b>really</b> seem like you mean it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> <b>O-kay</b>!</p>

<p>(He closes the door before Rachel can say anything.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! That guy is so rude!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well you did a little bit.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I totally forgive you!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is making a drink as Phoebe enters with the fur
coat.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Crematorium Chris? Sure!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know,
bring in the next person I know who dies.</p>

<p>(Rachel enters from the bathroom and sees the coat.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big
kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a
crime against nature! Not nature, <b>fashion</b>!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, <b>death</b>
is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's
Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps
of wintry Russia. I mean, you <b>really</b> thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the
mirror.) 'Cause I do.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's Apartment, the gang is helping Ross move out by carrying boxes. Chandler
has picked a particularly large and apparently heavy box, because he takes a running start
at it and still can't budge it.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you.
Bye. (Hangs up.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, what is in here? Rocks?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, rocks. </p>

<p>(He picks up a smaller box and carries it to the moving van as Joey returns.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps
right over there. (Points.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off
the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You <b>do</b> have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are
you, are you crazy?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters
behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys
said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told
me that he's not entirely happy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We all hate Emily!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nooo!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're
having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys
gets married! You have <b>no</b> idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right,
it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all
laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real
life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler are recovering from Ross's
rebuke.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> God, I feel so guilty about Ross.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I kinda feel like it's my fault.</p>

<p>(Monica and Chandler turn and stare at him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've
happened.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound
to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I think it's very brave what you said.</p>

<p>(Monica pats Joey on the shoulder.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on
her fur coat.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal
rights thing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very
nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I&#151;it's the best thing I've ever had
wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to
Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!</p>

<p>[Scene: Their building's lobby, Danny is checking his mailbox as Rachel enters carrying
shopping bags and goes to her mailbox. Danny has shaved his beard and cut his hair, Rachel
doesn't recognize him.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> So you like the short hair better.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Yeti&#151;I mean Danny?</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know
if you hadn't looked so&#133;. Y'know.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (shocked) What?</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> That's cool. Cool. (Starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't!
Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Do you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Okay. (Heads for his apartment.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And stop saying that! I hate that!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Okay!</p>

<p>(Rachel decides not to give up that easily and follows him to his apartment and bangs
on the door, which he opens.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you
are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up
your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> The pizza-place across the street any good?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Okay.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Stop saying that. I hate that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's now empty apartment, he is spackling some holes shut as the gang comes
to apologize.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, Ross?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Are you still mad at us?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh good! Because we have an &quot;I'm sorry&quot; song.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff
and I just acted like a jerk.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we are so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play
but is stopped by&#133;)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, we were <b>way</b> out of line, we totally support you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Whatever you decide, whatever you do.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, <b>now</b> you're just taking lines right out of the song!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes! Exactly! And that's why&#133;</p>

<p>(She starts to play her song, but is stopped by Monica.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a
seeing-eye dog coat!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang, minus Rachel, are getting ready for dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You do, huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions
right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes
like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander
around, you're alone&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (thinks) I'm not sure.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, look at you! Where have you been?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How did that happen?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That yeti is one smooth talker.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> No! Why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you
with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really&#133; I don't mind.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh&#133; It would
really mean a lot to me if you stayed.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, I&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> <b>RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!</p>
</b>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor&#133;</p>

<p>[Time lapse, dinner is now finished and Ross is looking out the window.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!</p>

<p>(They all run over to the window.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I haven't seen him in so long!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll
all be hanging out together.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's almost as if he knew.</p>

<p>(The phone rings.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh
you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah,
sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.</p>

<p>(Ross puts her on speakerphone.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi Emily!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure
who's not here and that's Rachel!!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (laughs) Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.</p>

<p>(Rachel waves her hands in disgust and starts to head for her room.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> She's there?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, there-there she is!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah, she's here.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Ross, take me off speakerphone.</p>

<p>(He does so.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel
perfectly clear!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends,
okay?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> You obviously can't keep away from her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends
out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll
see you're the only person I want to be with.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the
time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never
gonna work if you don't trust me.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> You're right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So, can you trust me?</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> No.</p>

<p>(Ross lowers his head.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the inside of the apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his
back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera
cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey
alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back
inside.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I guess that's it.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Why, what happened?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What happened? What happened?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My marriage is over.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.</p>

<p>[Scene: A curbside newsstand, Phoebe is whistling and walking up to it wearing her fur
coat. She stops and starts to look through a magazine and notices a squirrel on a nearby
tree chirping at her.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're
mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be
coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here.
(She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Joey is looking at a <i>National
Geographic</i> and giggling.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you looking at naked tribe's women?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's a pig.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.</p>

<p>(Ross enters and his hair is a mess.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Emily's cousin kicked me out!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then
you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who needs a lease when <i>it's family</i>!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise
me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You got it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get
packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.</p>

<p>(Joey starts giggling.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He thought you said gonad.</p>

<p>(Joey busts out laughing.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica's restaurant, she is getting inspected by the health department, Phoebe
is watching.]</p>
<b>

<p>Health Inspector:</b> Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a
tough time making a living.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Larry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, do health inspectors work on commission? </p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> No, bribes.</p>

<p>(Phoebe laughs.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's okay to laugh right?</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Yeah, I was just kidding.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (She laughs harder.)</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> I'll check the kitchen floors.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.</p>

<p>(He goes into the kitchen.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yum-my!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Larry?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> (entering) A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your
chef's hat, and <b>that</b> is a Section 5 violation.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know
that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> And where is your hat?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it. </p>

<p>(She heads for the kitchen door and just after she goes through the door&#133;)</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Ahh <b>that's</b> the 2 points.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You <b>saw</b>
the hat in the kitchen and <b>knew</b> that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.
You can have your own health inspector detective show!</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Oh, I don't know about that.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner
sometime.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places
to eat.</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> I-I'll call ya.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(Larry goes to leave but heads the wrong way and makes a quick sidestep to go out the
right door.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is serving Monica and Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hmm?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're
not gonna try&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff
again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I
don't go for guys right after they get divorced.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.</p>

<p>(Danny enters.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> (To Gunther) Two pounds of Moca Java please.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.
I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> (To them) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's
sort of a house warming kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh, fun!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, great!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Okay, see ya. (Heads out.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out,
because he wants <b>me</b> to ask him out.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And you're not gonna do that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That's right! 'Cause <b>that</b> would give him the control! So now he's
all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint
around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So-so there is no party.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up
for grabs. You follow me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes
you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, they're entering to find boxes strewn about the
apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Love what you've done with the place.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really
appreciate you guys letting me stay here.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while,
why don't&#151;I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check
this out. (He plays the greeting, and <i>We Will Rock You</i> starts to play and Ross's
voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, all right!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<p>(They both laugh as Ross heads back to the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, the tears are real.</p>

<p>[Scene: A restaurant, Phoebe and Larry are having dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> You look beautiful this evening.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (smiles) Show me the badge again.</p>

<p>(He looks around and flashes her his badge and she laughs.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Shiny. </p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who
knows where these babies (Holds up his hands) have been.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (laughing) You are just nonstop!</p>

<p>(He goes to the bathroom and Phoebe puts some pepper and salt on her food. With the
salt she takes a bit and throws it over her left shoulder as she faces us.)</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> (coming back) We're outta here!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why?!</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this
place down!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (awed) You have the power to do that?</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> This does. (Shows her his badge.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (excited) Shut it down.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is entering. As he closes the door, Joey pokes
his head up from a box enclosure built using the 2 chairs.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You built a fort didn't ya?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (smiles) Kinda.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier!
All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I <b>hate</b> this thing!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't
you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is opening the door.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hi Danny.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You are?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Yeah, what's the gala for?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's a uh, regatta gala.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Really! You-you sail?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no, but I support it.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Okay, (To Monica) hope I see you tomorrow night.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Take care. (Leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would
know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I
said, &quot;No!&quot; Which puts <b>me</b> right back in the driver seat.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Great. So the ball is in his court?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ball? There is no ball.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Ross is working on his computer and Joey is
making a lot of noise.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p>(Joey starts playing with a toy alligator and has it attack him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahhhhhhhhhh&#133; </p>

<p>(Notices Ross looking at him and stops. Ross gives him his 'quiet down' maneuver. Okay,
this may take a while to explain, so center this on you screen and place your hands about
a foot apart with your fingers together and pointing straight up. Now take you fingers and
point them at the other hand and making a 90-degree angle with each of your hands and the
first knuckle counting up from the wrist. Now take your right hand, no your other right
(that was for the dyslexics), and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are
pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in
front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your
shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to
turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver. Well, there is an accompanying face, but
I don't want to try and describe it as well.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hello children!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the
boxes. Come on!</p>

<p>(They go into his bedroom.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I have one question. <b>What</b> is the deal with this?
(Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps
his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, the quiet down thing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you
know he taped over my <i>Baywatch</i> tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that
had been porn?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is
Ross! I survived college with him!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(They start playing.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no-no!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> YES!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs
up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so he's out of here.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Um-hmm.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken
and it was closed!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it
down!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where
are we gonna eat?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't know, clean places?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm, yum!</p>

<p>(There's a knock on the door and Monica answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (looking through the peephole) It's Danny.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it
starts later?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The fake kind! </p>

<p>(She opens the door and Rachel hides behind it.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Thanks, see you at the party.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, great! </p>

<p>(He leaves and she closes the door.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, &quot;See you
ladle.&quot; (Laughs.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are there. Chandler and Joey are looking
through the paper.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports?
International? Apartment listings?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'll take sports.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Mine! (He grabs it.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right. Uhh, international.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though
there's never anything in here.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Not even on page 7?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (looks) Oh yeah! You're&#151;hey, you're right! Here's an affordable
place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What about that circled one?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But it's available now! Isn't it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, it is.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, let's go.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There we go!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in
on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Let's go quicker.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p>[Scene: The apartment in the listing, the guys are checking it out. There's one problem
though, it's roughly the size of this computer screen. As they enter Joey lets out a
whistle.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great!
Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.</p>

<p>(They don't move, just look all around them.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But hey, Ross, this place is available now!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>(He looks at them.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, it's perfect!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Chandler) How about you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's a kitchen slash bathroom.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and
fill out an application.</p>

<p>(He exits.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We are bad people.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we
could get a bathtub in our kitchen?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there waiting for Larry.]</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> (entering) Hey, ready for dinner?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, absolutely!</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker
Street right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> How about Mama Lisettie's?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Enh. Sure!</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> (notices something) I wonder how long that milk (on the counter) has been
setting out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That&#151;this milk is mine. I
bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has
to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!</p>

<p>(Just as they're about to leave, Gunther comes out of the back carrying two garbage
bags. Larry sees this and stops him.)</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Hey, buddy! (Flashes his badge.) Are you familiar with Section 11-B of
the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the <b>back</b> exit?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the
health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like,
okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?</p>

<p><b>Larry:</b> Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go!
(He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I
know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are lamenting about how they kicked Ross
out.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes that was a nice place!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the
window in a bag!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are we gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know. Maybe pizza?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> About Ross!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh! Oh!</p>

<p>(The phone rings and Joey answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross
put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll
ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh,
barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap
dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that <b>is</b> a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp!
(Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello? </p>

<p>(The apartment manager hung up on him and he hangs up the phone and throws in on the
chair. Joey motions, &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Chandler makes a face to say,
&quot;Think about it.&quot; Joey tries to divide 136 by 13; he's confused. Suddenly, light
dawns on yonder dunder head. He gets it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohhhhh!</p>

<p>(Joey motions, &quot;Now, that's thinking!&quot;)</p>

<p>[Scene: Downstairs at Danny's party, Monica and Rachel are coming down the stairs and
Rachel has on a coat to make it look as if she's just getting back. But just as they reach
the landing they see Danny out in the hall talking to a guest, Rachel then quickly pulls
Monica back up the stairs.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Just go over and say hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from
the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.</p>

<p>(Monica obeys.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Danny!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Hey! What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food.
Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this
Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly
retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm,
what's this? (Points to his plate.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Salad.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and
what-what's this? (Points again.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Bread. Aren't you a chef?</p>

<p>(Rachel returns.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Hey! Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. (He heads off.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I thought there wasn't a ball?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere,
balls flying all over the place!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> (returning, with a friend) Rachel, this is my friend Tom. (To Tom) <b>This</b>
is the girl I told you about.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, go on! You telling people about me?</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle. (Leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Tom:</b> So you work at <i>Bloomingdale's</i>, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!</p>

<p><b>Tom:</b> I'm sorry?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going
on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!</p>

<p><b>Tom:</b> I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, &quot;Nice
try.&quot;</p>

<p>(He walks off.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right
out of the park!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think I need a drink.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p>(They go get a drink.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross still has boxes all over the place. Joey is wearing a
football helmet, and Chandler is spinning him around in one of the chairs and counting.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and
falls flat on his face.)</p>

<p>(He tries to get up again and starts falling backwards and Chandler catches him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here we go! Here we go!</p>

<p>(Ross enters.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my
application.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You're kidding!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're kidding, no!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her
place for a while. So&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points
to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his
door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you guys sure about this?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Definitely!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! Ross, you have to stay!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, buddy!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain
in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay?
And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the
'quiet down' maneuver).</p>

<p>(Chandler and Joey smile, but when Ross turns away look at each other with looks of
horror.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Chandler is entering and when he closes the
door Joey pops his head out of the fort like before, but this time he's wearing a cowboy
hat.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the
cowboy hat is a little much?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a
bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!</p>

<p>(Chandler does so.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone has just finished Thanksgiving dinner and are
groaning over their fullness.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh Monica that was the <b>best</b> Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you
killed us.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I couldn't possibly eat another bite. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I need something sweet.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does anyone wanna watch TV?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>(She starts pushing the power button on the remote, but it's not facing the TV so it
doesn't work.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica your remote doesn't work.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Aw, forget it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where
everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's very nice.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's sweet, Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came
in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also
thankful for thongs. (Note: Actually, I think <b>every</b> guy is thankful for thongs.
That and spandex. <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> )</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier. Joey is talking about the wonder
that is the thong.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I
mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play
with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you aware that you're still talking?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my
eviction? Hmm.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no! <b>I</b> am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just
swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got
divorced again are you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh God, no.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler
bumming us out!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay,
moved out, and abandoned its entire family.</p>

<p>(And with that, we start a series of flashbacks to Thanksgiving's of years gone by.)</p>

Thanksgiving dinner as a housekeeper serves them.]</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a
divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the
house-boy than me.</p>

<p><b>The Housekeeper:</b> More turkey Mr. Chandler? (And he makes eyes at him.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Present Day</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really? Worse than, &quot;More turkey Mr. Chandler?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's
worse!</p>

Union soldier. (By the way, for historical perspective, 1862 was the second year of the
American Civil War.)]</p>
<b>

<p>Past Life Phoebe:</b> More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more
bandages in here! This man is dying&#151;(She is cut off by an exploding shell just
outside the tent. When the smoke clears, she's missing an arm and the blood is pumping out
like you'd see in a horror movie. And upon seeing her condition, she says&#133;) Oh no.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Present Day</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> In <b>this</b> life, Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past
life memories.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, let's not tell this story.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh, come on!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck
on his head!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, it's not like it sounds.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's <b>exactly</b> like it sounds.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Thanksgiving 1992</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Phoebe is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (muffled) Hello?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (surprised) Hello?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Joey? What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know! It's stuck!!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I put it on to scare Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells <b>really</b> bad in here.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead
animal.</p>

<p>(They hear Monica trying to unlock the door. So Phoebe quickly pushes his head down
onto the table to make it look like the turkey is just sitting on a platter and not stuck
on Joey's head.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, did you get the turkey basted&#151;Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees
someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's Joey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, get it off now!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can't! It-it's stuck!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my
parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.</p>

<p>(They all start thinking. Joey starts rubbing his chin, of course his chin is currently
inside the turkey so he ends up rubbing the turkey. And I didn't do that joke one bit of
justice. It's one of those you have to see it to get it jokes.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs
as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sorry! Sorry.</p>

<p>(They get into position to pull the turkey off.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!</p>

<p>(They both pull but Joey slips out and starts to fall backwards just as Chandler
enters, scaring him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the
doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm over here big guy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are!
(Starts dancing.) I scared you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (laughing) You did look like an idiot.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember
when Ross tried to say, &quot;Butternut squash?&quot; And it came out, &quot;Squatternut
buash?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah that's the same.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even
know that happened. So which one was it?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Which one?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what
Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!</p>

dinner. The doorbell rings.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With
The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She
goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<p><b>Big Nosed Rachel:</b> Not for me. Chip and I broke up!</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> Oh, why? Why? What happened?</p>

<p><b>Big Nosed Rachel:</b> Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was
going to come over&#133;</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.</p>

<p><b>Big Nosed Rachel:</b> Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It <b>really</b>
creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's
thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greets
Monica's parents.) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Hi Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Big Nosed Rachel:</b> Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> You too sweethart!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey! </p>

<p>(He brought home Chandler for Thanksgiving. Chandler is sporting the very popular Flock
of Seagulls haircut. Yeah, it's another you have to see it to believe it kinda thing.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Oh my!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, this is Monica.</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (seeing her) Okay.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I
hope you're hungry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving
food.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese
for dinner.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.</p>

<p>(As she is drinking, Monica laughs and Chandler's joke and <i>Diet Coke</i> comes out
of her nose.)</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> dammit! (Runs off.)</p>

<p>(Ross points out Rachel to Chandler and goes over to talk to her. Rachel is checking
out her nose in her compact mirror.)</p>

I've been away at college.</p>

<p><b>Big Nosed Rachel:</b> Oh! No, not really.</p>

<p>(Rachel wanders into the kitchen where Monica is making Chandler's dinner.)</p>

<p><b>Big Nosed Rachel:</b> Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that <b>slut</b>
Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy
Branson.</p>

<p><b>Big Nosed Rachel:</b> Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are
just silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were
looking for.</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> Call them mom and dad you loser!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (in a high pitched voice) Monica!</p>

<p>[Time lapse, dinner has finished and Chandler is sitting on the couch eating some pie.

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> Okay!</p>

<p>(He gets up and walks away as Rachel come running over all excited.)</p>

already kinda did it once y'know.</p>

<p><b>Fat Monica:</b> I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna <b>definitely</b> know
whether or not you did it!</p>

<p><b><b>Big Nosed Rachel:</b></b> I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised
that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!</p>

<p>[Cut to the kitchen, Ross and Chandler are doing the dishes.]</p>

her that song we wrote last week.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don&#146;t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're

<p>(Monica enters behind them.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.</p>

<p>(Monica suddenly gets very happy.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with
your fat sister.</p>

her parents.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I do.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the
stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it wasn't. It was actually the&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for
Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know
whatever.</p>

is helping her.]</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology
building.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh hi!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Wow, love your new nose!</p>

(He starts to show her as the doorbell rings.)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I'll get it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)</p>

<p>(She opens the door to reveal Chandler and Ross. Unfortunately, they seem to have their
holidays mixed up. They think it's Halloween and they're going as Crockett and Tubbs from
that legendary TV show of the late 80's, <i>Miami Vice</i>. God, we looked silly back
then!)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving! </p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> (To Chandler) God, your hair sure is different!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we
used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So uh, where's Monica?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel,
and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>(Monica enters, but she forgot something. Oh, about 150 pounds. In other words, she
lost weight, big time!)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi, Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She
turns around making sure he gets a good look.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Dude!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to
hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart.
And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays
for both teams!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.</p>

<p>(She heads for the kitchen and Chandler watches her leave and admires the view.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Dude!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p>(In the kitchen.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back
for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well it didn't!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart
is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him
back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then
I'm going to point at him and laugh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, <b>that</b> we may be able to do.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight
so that I can give my flower to someone like him!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever
take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just
gonna make him think that you are.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the
door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then, you will <b>definitely</b> get him back!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns
you on.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!
(She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against
my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it
down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (excited) I can do that!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler)
Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac
and cheese like last year.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to
follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and
cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them
between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and
hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm,
and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a
knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder)
and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any
exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the
box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you all right?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that&#151;(She drops the box and
in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips
through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The hospital, Chandler has been rushed to the emergency room.]</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> What do we got here?</p>

<p><b>The Paramedic:</b> Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.</p>

<p>(They go through the doors into the trauma room, opening them by ramming the gurney
through them, only Chandler's foot is hanging off the end and he screams in pain.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is!
Severed toe, you <b>just </b>said it!</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Of course it did. They're made of wicker.</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> Did you bring the toe?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her
purse and hands it to the doctor.)</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> (opening it) Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and&#151;(Stops
suddenly.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! What is it?</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> You brought a carrot.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You brought a carrot?!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!</p>

<p><b>The Doctor:</b> It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Without my toe?! I need my toe!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your <i>Porsche</i>!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Oh, I'm not falling for that one!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Present Day</strong></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I didn't <b>mean</b> to cut it off. It was an accident.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He
storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler! (Follows him out.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You're a dork.</p>

<p>[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is standing in front of his door.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can't believe this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, I said I was sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, sorry doesn&#146;t bring back the little piggy that cried
all the way home! I <b>hate</b> this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you
later.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Chandler is sitting on one of the chairs and the
duck is running around him and quacking.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, &quot;Quack, quack!&quot; I&#146;m happy all
the time!</p>

<p>(There's a knock on the door and Chandler gets up to answer it. He opens the door to
reveal Monica with a turkey over her head.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nice try.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, Monica&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This is not going to work.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You are so great! I love you!</p>

<p>(Monica stops suddenly and turns around slowly.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing! I said, I said &quot;You're so great&quot; and then I just, I
just stopped talking!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You said you loved me! I can't believe this!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No I didn't!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the entire gang is there, eating breakfast. Phoebe is on
the couch, fidgeting.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What am I sitting on?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but
can't) I'm out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies! </p>

<p>(She throws them into the kitchen and Rachel picks them up with the handle of a large
spoon. Chandler and Monica have horrified looks on their faces.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, they're not mine!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!</p>

<p>(Rachel turns and stares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, they're mine.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why are they here?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know uhh&#133; (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey.
Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of
the way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're <b>your</b> underwear.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.</p>

<p>(Follows Joey into their apartment and shrugs on his way out.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the guy's apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop!
(Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's
room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep
embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I
didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a
play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his
pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough
spot.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, yeah actually.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want
everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really
well is because it's a secret.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We are! Help us!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Help!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Didn't think so.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters
with her nose stuck in a book.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Phoebe!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you reading?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, <i>Wethering Heights</i>. I'm taking a literature class at the New
School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this
time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less
painful final exam.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey that sounds like fun.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to
sit with!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Okay&#151;ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I read that in high school.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering, depressed) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What's wrong buddy?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Someone at work ate my sandwich!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, what did the police say?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross, it's just a sandwich!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice
and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone
<b>ate</b> the only good thing going on in my life!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was
going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I <b>still
can't believe someone ate it</b>!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. </p>

<p>(Shows the note to Chandler who reads it aloud.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's
lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I
learned that living on the street.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, &quot;Keep your
mitts off my grub?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she
surrounded by the <b>entire</b> cast of <i>Annie</i>?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and
the gang reads it.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Whoa! Ohh!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you are a bad ass!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he stabbed me first!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe's class, the class has already started and Rachel walks in late.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Phoebe) Sorry I'm late, but I left late.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So Pheebs, what is the book about?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I thought you said you read it in high school.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep
rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway&#151;umm, what is this book about?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and
umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which <b>I</b> think
represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see
here (looks at his attendance sheet), Rachel Green?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which <b>I</b>
think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, honey that was pretty obvious.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> What do you think? You in the blue shirt.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Would ya care to venture one?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Would <b>you</b> care to venture one?</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Are you just repeating what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Are you just repeating what <b>I'm</b> saying?</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> All right, let's move on.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay then.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel return from the class.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was
really embarrassing what happened to you!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Phoebe! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but
people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller,
yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for
me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with
people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani,
give me that coffee! Now!</p>

<p>(Joey casually pushes Ross over the back of the couch and sits down proud of himself.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway, Joey is returning from a date with Cynthia.]</p>

<p><b>Cynthia:</b> God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask
me out.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So you uh, still wondering?</p>

<p><b>Cynthia:</b> No, we just went out.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You're smart. I like that.</p>

<p>(He goes to open the door to his apartment, but finds it locked. As he's getting out
his keys, Chandler and Monica quickly jump up from making out in the living room and run
to Chandler's bedroom. The apartment has about 20 candles burning all over the place. Joey
opens the door and ushers Cynthia in.)</p>

<p><b>Cynthia:</b> Oh, candles! (Notices something.) What is that? A blanket? A video
camera? Oh my God! (As she storms out, Rachel returns and overhears the conversation.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!</p>

<p><b>Cynthia:</b> I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having
sex on the first date! (She storms away and Rachel enters to confront Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hiya.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, is what she just said umm&#151;Oh my God. (Looks around the room.)
You were actually gonna&#133; (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.)
(Rachel stares in shock.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What is going on here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?</p>

<p>(Chandler silently pleads with Joey to cover for them.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points
at Chandler, angrily.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's; continued from earlier. Joey is closing the door
after Rachel leaves and is about to confront Chandler and Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys <b>promised</b> you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good
Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We're so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the
underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them
you <b>had</b> to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found <b>my</b>
underwear at your place?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh&#151;I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just
give us a little more time.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts
for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Museum of Prehistoric History (Ross's work); Ross is in the break room
eating lunch as his boss, Dr. Leedbetter walks in.]</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, of course, Donald.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your
part.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently
people now call you mental.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Proudly) Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> We want you to speak to a psychiatrist. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all
because of a sandwich.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> (laughs) A sandwich?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her
secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the
Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here&#133; </p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> (laughs) Oh, you know what?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You ate my sandwich?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey
sandwich with a Moist Maker?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (getting angry) That said it was <b>my</b> sandwich?!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still
be in the trash.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (jumping to his feet in anger) What?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it
away.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!</p>

<p>[Cut to an outside shot of the museum.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!</p>

<p>[Cut to a shot of a park.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> <b>MY SANDWICH!!!!!!</b> (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's class; Rachel walks in, on time this time.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You didn't read this one either?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>Vogue</i>! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! You should've read it yourself!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on Phoebe! Don&#146;t be such a goodie-goodie!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a
woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> (entering) Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did
everybody think about Jane Eyre?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very
interesting insights.</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Well, go ahead Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane
Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch as Monica joins him.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I
thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (gasps) You're <b>naked</b> in this picture!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<p>(Ross walks in, eating cotton candy. Monica nudges Chandler who hides the picture in
his magazine. Ross sits down on the chair, he seems kinda out of it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> On account of my rage.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Which I may say, right now, is out of control.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He gave me a pill for it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> A pill?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of
absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a
tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And you're okay with that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I,
I definitely don't care about my sandwich.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are returning from class.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you
let me go on and on like that!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing <i>Jane
Eyre </i>to <i>Robocop</i>. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That was <b>not</b> funny!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be
something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know,
people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high
school.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just
wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?</p>

<p>[Scene: The Class; Monica has taken Rachel's spot.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!</p>

<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Monica, you <b>asked</b> the question.</p>

<p>(She sits back defeated, and Phoebe groans with disgust.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's; Joey returns carrying a bucket of chicken, and
starts going through the mail. While doing this, Monica's picture falls out. He bends over
to pick it up and gasps. While he's staring at the picture, Rachel decides to come over
and sees him looking at the picture.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey has got a secret peephole!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us!
And then he eats chicken and looks at them!</p>

<p>(Ross stares in shock at him as he angrily puts down the chicken and takes off his
coat.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the
gang.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (grabbing the picture) Give me that!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give
our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! I am <b>not</b> a pervert! Okay? It's just&#133; I just&#133;
Kinda&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.</p>

<p>(He walks over and stands behind Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey's a sex addict. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading
with Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! No! I am <b>not</b> a sex addict!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what is the truth?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, what's going on?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (thinking) I slept with Monica.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well let's&#133;.let's see what everybody thinks of that?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You slept with my sister?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, is this true?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's
been going on?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes it's true.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your
underwear in our apartment the other day?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahh&#151;oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.
Right Monica?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My God Monica!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been
trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That makes sense!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And the video camera?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, Monica?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But sadly I could not be enticed.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you
do that?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's
not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so
the chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's apartment, Ross is cleaning out the fridge. Joey
walks from his room. He looks like he just woke up.]</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>What are you doing?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Ross:</b> </b>I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy.
(There&#146;s nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (There&#146;s
one lone tomato.) And top shelf: expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> Why are you doing this?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Ross:</b> </b>Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I&#146;ve already been to the
bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You&#146;ve got to
spread it out a little, you know. Haven&#146;t you ever been unemployed?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Ross:</b> </b>Hey, I am not <b>unemployed.</b> <b>I&#146;m on sabbatical!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>Hey, don&#146;t get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little
confused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why
do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here&#133;sit down. (Ross sits
down.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh,
yeah!! Huh?!</p>
<b>

<p><b>Ross:</b> </b>So what, we just sit?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>Ohh, no, no. We&#146;re not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and
hits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)</p>
<b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> </b>(Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>(In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> </b>(Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and
Joey laugh silently.) It&#146;s been six months! <b>It&#146;s not funny!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>But, <b>I love you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> </b>Leave me alone! For the love of <b>God, </b>leave me <b>alone!!!</b>
(Joey hangs up.)</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>And that&#146;s Wednesday. (He reclines in his chair.) Ohh.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are there. Phoebe walks
in ringing a bell.]</p>
<b>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> </b>Hey you guys, guess what?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> </b>The British are coming?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> </b>Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.)
Since it&#146;s Christmastime. I&#146;m going to be one of those people collection
donations.</p>
<b>

<p>All: </b>Ohh.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> </b>(Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my
bucket.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> </b>Ohh.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> </b>Yeah, yeah, I&#146;m going to be out there spreading joy to the
people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year,
I&#146;m going to do the whole city.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Monica:</b> </b>You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was <b>very</b>
popular. (Chandler laughs.)</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> </b>Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by <i>Macys</i>. Yeah, they
hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I&#146;m the only one who can sing
&quot;Merry Christmas&quot; in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> </b>Oh my god. Ok you guys, there&#146;s Danny. Watch. Just watch this.
(He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he&#146;s not interested.
Ohh, he&#146;s coming over. Just pretend like we don&#146;t know him. We&#146;ve forgotten
who he is.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Danny:</b> </b>Hey guys.</p>
<b>

<p>All: </b>Hey Danny.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Monica:</b> </b>Danny? You know Rachel? She&#146;s nice. She&#146;s not bad to look
at, right?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> </b>Thanks, Mon.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Danny:</b> </b>Well, of course.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Monica:</b> </b>Do you want to go out on a date with her?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> </b>Monica!!!</p>
<b>

<p><b>Danny:</b> </b>(Looking at Monica) Absolutely! Is Friday okay?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Monica:</b> </b>Friday&#146;s perfect...She can&#146;t wait.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Danny:</b> </b>(To Monica) On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? (To
Rachel) See ya Friday. (He walks out.)</p>
<b>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> </b>(Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what?
Don&#146;t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.</p>

<p>[Scene: Estelle's (Joey's Agent) Office, Joey is there.]</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian
actor from Queens.</p>
<b>

<p>Estelle: </b>Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She&#146;s a woman!</p>

<p>Estelle: </b>What can I say? She nailed it.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b> </b>(Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?</p>
<b>

<p>Estelle: </b>Well, you&#146;re just going to say no again but...gay porn.</p>

<p>[Scene: In front of <i>Macys</i>, Phoebe is collecting donations and ringing her bell.]
</p>
<b>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> </b>Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put
some change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up and
down as if she is spreading joy.)</p>
<b>

<p><b>Monica:</b> </b>(Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!</p>
<b>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> </b>Hey!</p>
<b>

<p><b>Monica:</b> </b>I just wanted to see how it's going.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> </b>Well, it's going okay.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Monica:</b> </b>(Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, thanks!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow!</p>

<p>(Monica puts some change in Phoebe's bucket.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just get your nails done?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her
change purse into the bucket.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and
spreads her joy.)</p>

<p>(A man walks up and puts a dollar bill in.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you! And Happy Holidays.</p>

<p>(The man starts to take some change out.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, you can't take the money out.</p>

<p><b>The Man:</b> I'm making change. I need change for the bus.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.</p>

<p><b>The Man:</b> I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still&#133;</p>

<p><b>The Man:</b> Bite me, blondie! (The man storms off.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just&#133; (She
scowls at him.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is telling Ross how he didn't get the part.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something
happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what
about those <i>Good Will Hunting</i> guys?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the
chances I could get those guys to star in it?</p>

<p>(Ross just stares at him until he figures it out.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait a second, I could star in it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Or that.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline
that takes, y'know? I can't do it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to
it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The
only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Done!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And it can't be Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's not.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Or Joseph.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (disappointed) Oh.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning. Monica enters from her room wearing
nothing but a robe.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, what's up?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm
around her.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, honey, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our
relationship!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You had no relationship!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the
plan!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with
Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway
girl.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the
date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.</p>

<p>(Rachel goes into her room and closes the door. Which allows Monica to let Chandler out
of her room.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on, hurry!</p>

<p>(Chandler runs out the door and closes it behind him. After a short pause the door
opens and Chandler comes rushing back through, grabs Monica, kisses her good-bye, and
heads back out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is trying to write his movie, Chandler is
playing a game on the counter by trying to flip a ping pong ball with a spoon into a
nearby bowl.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, how do you spell suspicious? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.</p>

<p>(Chandler makes it into the bowl.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler <i>Bing</i>, 0.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You're driving me crazy with that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I'll stop.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don&#146;t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!</p>

<p>(Chandler slides the bowl to the far end of the counter. He tries again, but he hits
the spoon to hard and the ball goes flying away.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You wanna play?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have
to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets
home.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a
notch?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm intrigued. </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit
back.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the
door.)</p>

<p>[Scene: In front of <i>Macys</i>, Phoebe is still ringing her bell. A guy puts some
change into the bucket.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you, Happy Holidays.</p>

<p>(Another woman walks up and throws something into the bucket.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't&#133; (The lady ignores her and
walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!</p>

<p>(Another guy walks by and throws his light cigarette butt in the bucket.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet
another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.
(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is
that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is reading what Joey wrote.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops
reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,
you're supposed to have <b>five</b> pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!
(Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The
official rulebook of Fireball.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven
mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter
fluid&#151;Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not
the creator of crazy lawsuit game!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to
work. (To Joey) Now come on! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p>(He tries to fire a burnt tennis ball into the bowl Chandler is standing by, but Ross
grabs the ball away from him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!
(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the
burn spots on his oven mitts.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside Danny's apartment, Danny and Rachel are returning from their date.]</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> I had a really nice time tonight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.</p>

<p>(He kisses her.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's
asleep on the couch.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,
&quot;Yes.&quot;) Ohhh! I saw <b>her</b> with you on the subway and now she's asleep on
the couch!</p>
<b>

<p>Danny's Sister:</b> (opening the door) Oh, I thought I heard you.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this
is Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Krista:</b> Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix
myself up!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Like it would help.</p>

<p><b>Krista:</b> You are so bad! (Hits him softly.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> You are! (Hits her back.)</p>

<p><b>Krista:</b> You are! (Hits him softly.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> You are! (Hits her back.)</p>

<p><b>Krista:</b> You are! (Hits him softly.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> You are! (Hits her back.)</p>

<p><b>Krista:</b> You are! (Hits him harder this time.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> You are so dead! I'm gonna get you. </p>

<p>(He starts chasing her around Rachel a couple of times before she runs into the living
room and he tackles her on the couch where he starts tickling her.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue
to ignore her.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is complaining to Ross and Monica about the
bucket.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put
in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does it look like an ashtray?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does it look like a urinal?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice
Bucket!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know
what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you
guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from her room) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica and <b>Ross:</b></b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys
wrestle?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Still, I was quick as a cat.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl
on the subway.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you're kidding.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, they were very y'know&#133;wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Too strong for me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna
go?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh fine.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start
wrestling.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
(She leaves them to wrestle.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is cleaning the foosball table, Joey is
working on his script.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in
20 minutes! Come on, Joe!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey's not going.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he
relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never
played.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.
Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on look guys, don't fight.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And the reason I'm doing this is because <b>I</b> am Joey's friend. And if
you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of
Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,
no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I paid for those tickets!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler are listening to a story being
told by Danny and his sister.]</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> &#133;so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here (His
sister) forgets the camera!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> When did that happen to you?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really
pretty bird and wanted to take a picture&#151;I didn't have my camera!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.</p>

<p><b>Krista:</b> Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (She
takes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does it
again. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of it
and some filling falls into his lap.)</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.</p>

<p><b>Krista:</b> Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. The
thing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his
crotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)</p>

<p><b>Krista:</b> We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Yep. (To Rachel) I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, great!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That was unbelievable! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, see? I told you!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't believe they're brother and sister.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They're brother and sister!!!</p>

<p>[Scene: In front of <i>Macys</i>, Phoebe has adorned her bucket with numerous signs.
Like &quot;We are <u>not</u> a urinal!&quot; and &quot;I have no <i>Macys</i> info.&quot;
And other stuff like that. She also has a scowl on her face as she is ringing her bell. A
little old lady walks up to make a donation but Phoebe stops her.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.
(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the
lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)</p>

<p>(Another man walks up with a drink in his hand, Phoebe stops him too.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and
then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his
face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker
walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought
I told you to get outta here!</p>

<p><b>Bob:</b> Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a
less high-profile spot.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Bob:</b> Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That chick can't handle my corner.</p>

<p><b>Bob:</b> Look, either you leave, or we remove you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)
(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for
that bitch. (The old lady.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Danny's apartment, there's a knock on the door and he answers it.]</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> What?! Why?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond,
and&#133;</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Oh great! That <b>special</b> bond again! Why do women have such a
problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on
here but let's&#133;</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Do-do you, do you have brothers?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Are you close with them?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no, they're not very nice people.</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So
what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it
does sort of&#133;</p>

<p><b>Krista:</b> (calling from the bathroom) Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!</p>

<p><b>Danny:</b> (seeing Rachel's shocked look) What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is there as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down
there and give them a project, ruin their day?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach
them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already
finished my five pages for today!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to
focus. Huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL
THE LIVE LONG DAY!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it.
And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So
would you guys read it for me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right. (Takes a copy.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right. (Takes another copy.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (Reading.) &quot;It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys
are hanging out.&quot; Ross (Points to him.)</p>

<p>(Ross and Chandler start to read Joey's script aloud.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey man.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What is up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it was me. I'm sorry. <b>I</b> over reacted.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest&#133;
(Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Could I <b>be</b> more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right
Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) I'm sorry too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am sorry, Ross.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's
it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to
both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well
you co-created Fireball. The end.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> This took you all day?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up
with new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are about to read another one of Joey's
efforts.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out.</p>

<p>(Monica and Rachel begin to read from the script.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi, how are you doing Kelly?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can <b>really</b>
appreciate it?</p>

<p>(They both start to read ahead.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This is disgusting!</p>

<p>(They both throw the scripts in his face.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are hosting a New Year's party. So the
place is crowded and in a shameless promotion for NBC they're watching Jay Leno's coverage
of New Year's from Time Square.]</p>
<b>

<p>Jay Leno:</b> (On TV to Dick Clark) Is there any entertainment there? What are people
doing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What's the matter?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so
y'know&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I'll take care of it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no, wait! Joey!</p>

<p>(They try to stop him, not sure of what he's planning. He ignores them and goes to talk
to Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (hopping) 73! 72! 71!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or
Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Awww, man! Really?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's a good point.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, great!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the
history.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, good point.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> (watching the ball drop) 3! 2! 1! <b>HAPPY NEW YEAR</b>!!</p>

<p>(And with that everyone starts playing tonsil hockey. Chandler with Monica, Ross with
Phoebe, and Joey with Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Happy New Year!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Happy New Year.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You too!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So did that do anything for ya?</p>

<p>(Rachel slowly walks away.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, after the party. Everyone has left, except for the gang.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But your divorce isn't even final yet.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I
am gonna make myself happy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do you want us to leave the room, or?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. <b>That</b>
my friends is my New Year's resolution.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a
planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the
ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than
you do of not making fun of us.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without
making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50
bucks could be the &quot;new thing you do that day!&quot; (Ross looks at him.) And it
starts right now!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?! How come?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love
it would be great if one of those was true.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really? Who-who have you taught?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I taught me and I <b>love</b> me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing
these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk
drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't gossip!</p>

<p>(They all laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass
that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I
mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? They were like this! </p>

<p>(She puts her hands over her breasts and indicates that the coworkers boob job resulted
in one pointing up and one pointing down with her hands by pointing up with one hand and
down with the other.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is talking to a beautiful woman as Chandler and Joey enter.]</p>
<b>

<p>Woman:</b> I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler and <b>Joey:</b> </b>Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I just asked that girl out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nice!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name
and phone number on it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Horn-swoggle.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits
down rubbing his temple.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep
quiet as Phoebe enters.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's
ear.) Hornswoggle.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, see you later.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the
guitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the
guitar.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm, okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the
chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She
starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use your
imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see
them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand
and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm,
Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might
find it amusing, I myself find it regular.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering with Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I didn&#146;t! Even when I found out&#133;umm, all right, well let's
just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep
it. (Goes into her room.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's
chords.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I
stopped by this guitar store and&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Did you, did you <b>touch</b> any of the guitars while you were there?
Did you?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings.
Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to
learn to play guitar?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Then don't touch one!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering, with Ben) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ben:</b> Hi! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi Ben!</p>

<p><b>Ben:</b> Auntie Monica!! (He runs to hug her.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else
see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the
pants!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I think they're very nice.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I like 'em.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I like them a lot.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally
wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe
there's something in that area.</p>

<p>(They all speak at once in general approval of his pants selection; Joey asks where he
got them. I can't pick out the rest of it.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store
that always smells so good and I thought to myself, &quot;Wow, (To Chandler) I never
really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.&quot;</p>

<p>(No one says anything.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh come on!! (Storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You look like a freak.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and
Monica.)</p>

<p>(Monica starts taking pictures of Ross and Ben, with the flash.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you, what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's my New Year's resolution!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What, to blind my child?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think
it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica
starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the
excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Elizabeth Hornswoggle's apartment; Ross is there on his date with her. They are
sitting on the couch watching a movie. Ross is obviously hot.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still
wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot? </p>

<p><strong>Elizabeth Hornswoggle:</strong> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, it must just be me then.</p>

<p>(He shifts on the couch and a ripping sound emanates from his lower regions, the sound
reminds one of a brief explosion of gas. In other words, it sounds like he farted. She has
a look of horrific wonderment, wondering &quot;Did he just fart?&quot;)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I
use your bathroom?</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> No, go ahead.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another
word he heads into her bathroom.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Elizabeth Hornswoggle's bathroom, Ross frantically pulls his shirt out and
drops his pants. He exhales in sheer ecstasy as the coolness of the bathroom envelops his
legs. He sits on the cast iron bathtub, again gasping in pleasure. He next grabs a
magazine and starts to blow air on his exposed legs, but that doesn't work the way he
wants it to. So he throws the magazine down, looks around for another idea, and finds one.
He jumps up and hops to the sink. He turns on the water and starts to splash some on his
legs, cooling them further.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh&#133;&#133;&#133;.</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> (yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is coming up!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 'Kay!</p>

<p>(He goes to pull up his pants, but can't seem to get them past his knees. He
frantically tries to pull them up to no avail. Panic sets in.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is drilling Joey on the chords as Monica looks on.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he
does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at all
last night?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes! Yes, I did.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Then do Iceberg!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <b>G</b>-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords?
(Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! I didn't touch a guitar!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, but you're questioning my method!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica
standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. (Leaves.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Your other student, was you!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of
him with a little kid and <b>THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!</b> (Storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying
to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play <i>Bad, Bad Leroy Brown</i>!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, singing) &quot;Baddest man in the whole damn town.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)</p>

<p>(Rachel looks shocked, gets over it, notices she's alone, and picks up the phone. The
last part of which is something she shouldn't have done, because the phone is already in
use. By Monica, and now Rachel can hear every word.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross
picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is
absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around
wondering what to do.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, The phone rings and Joey answers it.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (answering phone) Hello?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, Chandler's not here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, <b>you</b> can help me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nice!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they
must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I
can't put them back on. I can't!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of
the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a
large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It
doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.)
They're not coming on man.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm, do you see any&#151;oh, <i>Vaseline</i>? </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hold on.</p>

<p>(Ross proceeds to apply copious amounts of the lotion on his legs. He literally starts
spraying the back of his legs with the lotion, and as he applies some to his butt he makes
a happy face like he enjoyed that sensation. After using about half the bottle he again
tries to pull up his pants, but at the first sign of resistance, his hand slips off of the
pants and hits him in the forehead.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross? You okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the
powder have made a paste!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?! Uhh, what color is it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What difference does that make?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I'm just&#151;if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself
a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Joey, do you have a minute?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Dude, what am I gonna&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works
out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over
the place.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have <b>got</b> to tell you something!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What-what is it, what is it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot
tell anyone.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the
secrets but can't tell anyone!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the
phone&#133; (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his
fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing
that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his
current state.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm not listening to you!</p>

<p>(Chandler seeing that Joey has his eyes closed sneaks over and picks up the chicken.
The chicken starts flapping it's wings in protest as Chandler holds the chicken inches
from Joey's face. Joey stops yelling and upon opening his eyes sees the chicken, screams,
and falls to the ground in horror.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Elizabeth's apartment; Elizabeth is inquiring as to the delay in Ross's exit
from her bathroom.]</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get
kinda freaked out.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> No, let's just leave the lights on.</p>

<p>(Ross opens the door and steps into the living room. He has fully removed his pants and
holds them wrapped into a ball in front of his crotch. His legs are covered in the powder
and lotion paste. He looks terrible.)</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I had a problem.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is there to apologize to Phoebe.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method
was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch
a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You
really think I'm ready?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note.
However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table
and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sitting back down) Was the chord at least right&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is returning from his horrible trek back home without
pants on. The whole gang is there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm
a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> No. No, you're not a loser.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's
picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, be-because of the leather pants.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now
that's something.</p>

<p>(All at once.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That really is something; that's really cool.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Howdy partner!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with
fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss
Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a
cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go
do my laundry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.</p>

<p>(They both exit.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang
around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good luck, honey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, uh, Joey?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling
his fingers out of his ears.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be
okay and then we could talk about it. Right?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah.
Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to
Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Now? You want me to go over there now?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do you know something?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you know something?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I might know something.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I might know something too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What's the thing you know?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can't tell you what I know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well then I can't tell you what I know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, fine.</p>

<p>(Silence ensues.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You don't know!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, how about <b>I</b> go over there and <b>I</b> will walk into
Chandler's bedroom and <b>I</b> will see that thing that I think that I know is actually
the thing that I think that I know! (Note: Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that
line. She said it very quickly and didn't screw up a word. Try it yourself, it ain't that
easy.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> AND YOU KNOW!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I know!!!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you
known?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this
for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird
about that! Listen&#133; (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey and <b>Rachel:</b></b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So&#133;</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, <b>I</b> am going to go for a walk in the rain.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhh, yeah, me too.</p>

<p>(They both exit.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Ross, and Monica are there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it
anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs?
Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your <b>home</b>
planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And
Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from <i>Fraggile Rock</i>?! (He sits down and
sighs in relief.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to pry more information about Chandler
and Monica from Joey who's sitting on the couch and busy downing a pizza.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on Joey!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal,
so Monica and Chandler are doing it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can't believe you would say that!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! I mean come on! This is a <b>huge</b> deal! (She sits next to him on the
couch.) Fine I want&#151;I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (thinks) I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is he romantic with her?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are they in love?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (thinks) I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You don't know anything.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh, I know one thing!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They did it right there on the couch. </p>

<p>(He points to where she's sitting and she jumps up quickly.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there as Ross enters.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Ross!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have
a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting
married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!</p>

<p><b>All:</b>  What? Oh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry man.</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Here's your scone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down
on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK
FOOD!!!!!!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Did they teach you that in your anger management class?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and
Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the
Louisiana Purchase?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, I don&#146;t think anyone's mad about that.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Exactly! Because it's in the past!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's office, Monica and him are at a party his office is throwing.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we
celebrating?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a
real couple. We don't have to hide.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)</p>

<p>(They both stand real close together.)</p>
<b>

<p>Both:</b> We can't do that. (They separate.)</p>

<p>(Chandler's boss (Doug) walks up.)</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady
and what the hell is she doing with you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is
Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi, nice to meet you!</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Hi! And this is my wife Kara.</p>

<p><b>Kara:</b> Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! (Slaps Chandler on his butt.)</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, sir.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.</p>

<p>(Chandler does a fake laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. (They walk off leaving Chandler
and Monica alone.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What was that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That noise you just made?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that was my work laugh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? Your work laugh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one
too.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, check me out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(She walks up to where Doug is finishing another joke to another group.)</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> &#133;says $30 Father; same as in town.</p>

<p>(Monica does a fake laugh. For the laughs, you'll have to see the episode. I can't
describe them.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica is buying a muffin as Chandler runs in.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <b>And</b>! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you
repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis
with them. He's never even <b>talked</b> to me outside of work. Except for that time when
we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway,
I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, I thought you already had one.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park
and hit rocks at&#133;bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey
Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Monica) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What's up?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my
friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with
you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh y'know what, we don&#146;t have to talk about work. We can talk about
anything!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Umm&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, what's going on with you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nothing! You go!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I-I&#151;there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but
I don't anymore.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do
have a lot of work to do so if-if&#151;are you sure there's just not anything else?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Phoebe is settling a dispute between the chick and
the duck.]</p>

<p>(The duck quacks.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, then what happened?</p>

<p>(The duck flaps its wings frantically.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This
is not over!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! No!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and
now it's all covered in-in&#133; (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and
stuff.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's okay, Joe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, let's go Pheebs.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!</p>

<p>[Scene: A tennis court somewhere in the city of New York, it's the doubles match-up of
a century Chandler and Monica versus Doug and Kara.]</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Bing! </p>

<p>(Hits the ball towards Chandler who returns it back to him. He then hits the ball at
Monica who slams it and it bounces off Kara's leg.)</p>

<p><b>Kara:</b> Oww!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Game!</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. (To his wife.)
Are you all right sweethart?</p>

<p><b>Kara:</b> (out of breath and mouths) I'm not all right.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.</p>

<p>(They both walk off the court.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be
carved!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Let them win one.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's
popping pills.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're not even giving them a chance!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> They have racquets don't they?!</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?
(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.</p>

<p>(She serves to Doug who returns it to Chandler. As it bounces over his head Chandler
swings and misses.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oopsey, missed it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and
Kara and scores a point.)</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Nice shot.</p>

<p>(Chandler glares at her and she shrugs her shoulders. Monica serves again; and Kara
returns it.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I got it!!</p>

<p>(Chandler cuts in front of her and hits the ball high and long.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Chandler are returning from the game.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can't believe you let them win!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed
racquet from his bag.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I was frustrated.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It was my racquet.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I was frustrated with you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow
night.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what really bothers me? Is&#151;it's how-how different you act around
them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the &quot;I'll see you
around, Bing!&quot; &quot;Not if I see you first, Doug!&quot; (Mocks the fake laugh.) I
gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, the next morning the girls are there with Joey.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe we should check the trash chute.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.</p>

<p>(Ross enters.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> There he is!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.)
Where the hell have you been?!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just, y'know out.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What were you doing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You walked around all night in the city by yourself?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do
whatever I want!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He hooked up!! Tell us about her!</p>

<p>[Suddenly the door opens and Ross's mystery girl enters. I'll give you a hint to who it
is: OH&#133;.MY&#133;.GAWD!! Uh-huh, it's Janice.]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (entering) Ross you left you scarf in&#133;(sees everyone.) Hey you guys. (Does
the laugh.)</p>

<p>(They all turn and with shocked looks on their faces stare at Ross. Ross is at a loss
for words at this moment.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in <b>Yemen</b>!
I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh! Okay! (To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Does
her famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)</p>

<p>(They all turn and glare at Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You two will have very hairy children.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I didn't know you would say that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! Janice?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He
obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I <b>didn't</b> lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common!
We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So are you actually gonna see her again?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I <b>am</b> gonna see her again.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Damnit Phoebe!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is going through her purse as Rachel rushes in.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during
our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even
when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> My turn? What-what are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, &quot;I'll just
tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours.&quot; And he said,
&quot;Laundry? Is <b>that</b> my new nickname?&quot; And you said, &quot;No! You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me
know how that one turns out.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr.
Big&#133;(Thinks)&#133;ot.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Mr. Bigot. He tells the most <b>racist</b> jokes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and
Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Phoebe and Joey are there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes
the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And
they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Judge rules, no violation.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohhh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey guys!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p>(Neither of them turns around from watching the chick and the duck look for the tasty
treat.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with
Janice! </p>

<p>(They both turn around.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Are you serious?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to
me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It
is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an
old Wonton!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, tough call.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>[Scene: Doug's house, Chandler, Monica, and them are just finishing dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her
husband Bill. (Chandler does the laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Kara:</b> So how do you kids like your coffee?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, none for me. Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Just a little bit of sugar.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta
sweeten it up, huh? (Once again, with the laugh.)</p>

<p>(Doug and Kara go get the coffee.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, you get used to it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be
it for me on the work things.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out
with my boyfriend who I actually respect.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> (entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it
if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not
laugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.</p>

<p><b>Doug:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I just&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see
Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was
weak physically. You get it now honey?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I thought you could use the help.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is going through the mail as Joey enters.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure! Why?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps
lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right
now!</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler, Joey, and Ross's apartment, Rachel enters and sneaks up to Chandler's
bedroom where she overhears Chandler and Monica talking.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist
jokes now?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sorry! I'm just&#151;I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate
having to lie to Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But we're not ready to tell yet!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know! It's just that&#133;ever since high school Rachel was the one person I
told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.</p>

<p>(Rachel decides not to confront them and starts to walk out, knocking over a lamp in
the process.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the
fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I was actually&#151;I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm,
look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay great! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was
cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my
books!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'll get back to my new job.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> 'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and
is almost in tears.)</p>

<p>(After she exits, Chandler enters.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Man, she is really gullible.</p>

<p>(Monica motions that it went right over Rachel's head.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Janice are sitting on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Actually, I should get going.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on
sabbatical from work, right?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Yes! Yes! You did!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> What is wrong now?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my
marriage falls apart and then&#133;</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job!
And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee&#151;ahh!! Ross, we need to
talk.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Sometimes I feel&#133;</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> No-no-no, no. <b>I'm</b> going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our
day in the sun.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> (starting to cry) You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't
think I can take another second of you whining!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because <b>I'm</b>
too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that
<b>I</b> annoy <b>you</b>, Janice.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Well yeah!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OH&#133;MY&#133;GOD!!</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Are you gonna be okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I am now.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(Joey enters.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm, hi.</p>

<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey. (Laughs and exits.)</p>

<p>(Joey looks at Ross with a horrified look on his face.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Chandler is reading a magazine as Ross hands him a
beer.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Dude, we got to talk.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I
hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real
laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why would I be mad?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't
uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or
girls they're related to.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you
know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They
forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well,
but I want you to remember that <b>I</b> forgave you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven
dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it
down&#151;let's write it down!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, he is giving Monica a massage.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can't <b>believe</b> we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So
good for Monica! </p>

<p>(Chandler picks up the timer being used and turns it to zero at which it chimes.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That was a half an hour?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's your timer.</p>

<p>(They change places.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the <b>best</b>
massages!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, then massage me up right nice!</p>

<p>(She starts the massage, only she is doing extremely hard and Chandler is gasping in
pain.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's so good, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Say good-bye to sore muscles!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good-bye muscles!!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like
she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just&#151;I didn't know
what it was!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay,
I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from
the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking
for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of
this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that
everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion
stuff.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And you're gonna make them all disappear.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.</p>

<p>(Chandler picks up a basket from the table and puts it on his head.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Done.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store?
I'll help you out.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Great! Thanks, Rach!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. </p>

<p>(Both of them remove their hats as Phoebe enters.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, how's it going?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the
hospital.</p>

<p>(All at once.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is everything okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you all right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs! Sorry!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like
I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the
coffeehouse!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a
car right outside.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like
y'know, one life ends and another begins.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did
she die?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some
yogurt and she just never came back up again.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs, I'm so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; &quot;Okay dear,
you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout
counter.&quot; And y'know what? We <b>will</b> meet at the checkout counter.</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Bloomingdale's</i>, Rachel is fixing Joey up with some new clothes.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff
right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a
bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really? A purse?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It looks like a women's purse.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring
catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, <b>men</b>, carrying the bag.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See look, <b>women</b>, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and
looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse
looks good on me, a man.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Exactly! Unisex!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe you need sex. <b>I</b> had sex a couple days ago.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ursula's apartment, Phoebe is about to break the bad news to her sister. She
knocks on the door.]</p>

<p>Ursula: Who is it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's Phoebe.</p>

<p>Ursula: Oh great! (Opens the door.) (Disappointed) Oh, you. Umm, what's up?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?</p>

<p>Ursula: Umm, yeah&#151;no thanks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, well, umm Grandma died.</p>

<p>Ursula: Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Ursula: Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No you didn't!</p>

<p>Ursula: Well, then who's been dead for five years?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?</p>

<p>Ursula: Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it.
Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So&#133; I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two
tickets left.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. (Starts to leave.)</p>

<p>Ursula: Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are on the couch as Joey enters with his new
bag.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p>(As he walks past both Chandler and Ross notice the bag and stare at each other in
shock.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just
looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your
stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Your make-up!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not
until tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts
eating.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why would I return it? I love this bag!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, then you owe me $350.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards
that come with the bag.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (glaring at him) Joey&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am
definitely gonna get thanks to you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's the part, Anti-man?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.) </p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe's Grandmother's memorial, Phoebe is at the door welcoming people.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look,
here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.</p>

<p>(The gang arrives.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi sweetie!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, how are you holding up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (notices his bag.) Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.</p>

<p>(Another man, an older man, enters, looking around and bumps into Chandler.)</p>
<b>

<p>Man:</b> Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?</p>

<p>(The gang moves off as Phoebe greets the new guest.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, welcome.</p>
<b>

<p>Man: </b>Hello. Hello.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm here's your 3-D glasses.</p>
<b>

<p>Man:</b> Oh, umm, all right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So how did you know Francis?</p>
<b>

<p>Man:</b> Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I
was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?! What's your name?</p>
<b>

<p>Man:</b> Umm, Frank Buffay. </p>

<p>(Needless to say, Phoebe is stunned into silence. And one audience member gasps.) </p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> (Seeing the look on her face) Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh,
actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You're Frank Buffay?</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Shh! (Whispers) No! Joe Hill!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You just said&#133;</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you <b>so</b> much for coming.
(Hands back his glasses and hurries out.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But&#133;</p>

<p>(Phoebe takes one step after him and stops.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! What honey?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That was my dad!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p>(They all look down the hall he left from.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it
out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me.
(Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap
him in his face.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The Funeral Home, continued from earlier. Phoebe is returning after looking for
her father.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, did you catch him?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wh-what did he say?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He said, &quot;Nice to meet you Glenda.&quot; (They stare at her,
dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why?! Why not?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's
gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What did you say to him?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of
Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house
later.</p>
<b>

<p>The Pastor:</b> Could everyone please take their seats?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna
say good-bye to my Grandma.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, let's go say good-bye.</p>

<p>(They put on their glasses and try to find their way to their seats.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, after the funeral, everyone is there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ahhh, I think you look <b>great</b>! That bag is gonna get you that
part.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And a date with a man!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know what? Make fun all you want. <b>This</b> is a great bag! Okay? And
it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't
make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact
that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy <b>abandoned</b> you!
I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!
(Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, &quot;Yo, dad! You and
me outside right now!&quot; (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, at least you scared someone.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know it's funny, you'd <b>think</b> I'd be angry. I mean, you'd <b>think</b>
I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right.</p>

<p>(She goes over and tries to give Phoebe a massage. Phoebe yelps in pain and jumps away
from her.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to
Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She
starts giving Chandler a massage.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates
it! He's in pain!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No he's not!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (wincing) Yes, he is!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But the minute we start to lie to each other&#133; (Pauses after she
realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's audition, he is with bag.]</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Any time you're ready, Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a
table and I'll buy you a drink.</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> (stopping him) I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it
without the purse?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new
here. Maybe we should&#151;I'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a
question.)</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Sure. What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, first it's not a purse.</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Okay, anytime.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's
bag!</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Okayyyy! Anddd, go!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the
latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Umm, do you sell these bags?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Okay! Thank you! That was great!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah but I didn&#146;t read anything.</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> I think we've seen enough!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the
bag.) We got it! We got it!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is poking his head in.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, is Rachel here?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this
afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I
just wish you could tell me&#151;just say, &quot;I don't like your massages.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but now see you're crying!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at
work.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! You don't know me at all!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm crying here!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the <b>best</b> bad massages. If
anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves,
&quot;Who's the best of that?&quot; They'd have to go to you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad
massage, well who would get that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Absolutely!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. I suck!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! (They hug.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Frank Sr. is just arriving.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, thank you for meeting with me.</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Thank you. All right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on
the arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I just&#151;I need you to
state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> So, what did Francis leave me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yes. Yes. Yeah&#151;no. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her
purse) this lipstick.</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's (opens it) oh it's&#151;ew used. Umm,
cool.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my
official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You
and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Yes, yes I was.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium,
or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> It really says that?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hmm, okay, <b>total</b> abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A.
Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad,
bad man?</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. (Gets up to
leave.) But umm&#133; Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give
Lilly that, please? (Hands her a note.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note?
Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me
the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note,
would you give it to her please?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But you-you-you came to see Lilly?</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Yeah, yeah. Why?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.)</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> She what?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She's dead.</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a <b>big</b> mistake.</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> I can't believe this. I just&#151;I can't believe this.
How-how&#151;Oh my God. How long ago?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> 17 years ago.</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Oh! What about, what about the girls?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe,
(pause) is on this couch.</p>

<p>(Silence ensues.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, (Sits down next to her and brushes against her
leg.) Oops. (He backs up.) I just, I-I-I-I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t know what to say. I
just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very
sorry that I left?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know what, it doesn&#146;t matter what you say it's not gonna make a
difference anyway, so you can just go.</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That's a defense?</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on
backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You make up songs?</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did
it, how did it go. Umm. (Singing.) </p>
<i>

<p>Sleepy girl, sleepy girl.<br>
Why won't you go to sleep?<br>
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl.<br>
You're, you're, you're keeping me uppp! </i>(Yeah, that's to the tune of Smelly Cat.)<i></p>
</i>

<p>Yeah. </p>

<p>(Phoebe is trying not to smile. He moves closer and very shyly holds out his hand and
turns his head, hoping for Phoebe to take his hand. She doesn't.)</p>

<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm&#133; (Backs
away.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)</p>

<p>(She holds his hand for a little while then&#133;)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

Phoebe there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (dejected) Hi.</p>

<p><strong>All:</strong> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey man, how did the audition go?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems
with me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What kind of problem?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the
bag!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nooooo!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?
(She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey wait, Joey, I&#146;m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are
with it&#133; (Looks for help.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> &#133;I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can't believe I'm hearing this!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn&#146;t
have a bag, I just&#151;it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause)
controversial.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah umm, they're called wallets.</p>

putting stuff in boxes!</p>

<p>(They all run and join her at the window.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And we're done with the chicken fried rice.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Good idea! Yes!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It would be so cool to live across from you guys!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can,
we have a can and it's connected by a string!</p>

never realized how great it is!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm
gonna beat you to it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Joey, she <b>knows</b>! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we
saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up <b>against</b>
the window.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel
knows?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us
know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would
finally be over!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Or, we could <b>not</b> tell them we know and have a little fun of our
own.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wh-what do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry
we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling
them.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets.
I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You don't have any secrets!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey
shies away.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ugh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My
sexuality.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft&#151;hello Mr. Bicep!
Have you been working out?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles
uncontrollably.) Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, if you really wanna know, I'm&#151;Oh! I can't tell you this.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one
person I want to the most.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and
how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don&#146;t even see that it's
right there in front of you sipping coffee&#151;Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just
something to think about. I know I will.</p>

<p>(She makes a show of bending over to get her coat and showing off her bum. She then
walks out, leaving no one to eat her cookie.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, Chandler and Monica are there, of course. Like who else
would it be, duh!]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a
tiny little bunny.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, now you're even cuter!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think
Phoebe was hitting on me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's not possible!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ow!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were
charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my
bicep for crying out loud!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This bicep?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well it's not flexed right now!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, and Chandler are there. Monica is
entering from her room.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure, I'll do it with ya.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a
huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out
a lot! Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it
himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a
little bribe to </p>

<p>tip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window.
(They all head to the window.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That new mountain bike?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well what did you send?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> A basket of mini-muffins.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you
send?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The small one.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the
apartment?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy
over those little muffins. It was the best day.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Your work makes me sad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work!
There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Bye!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She
pinches his butt.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate
and the pinching!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Actually, I did!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you serious?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only
explanation for it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my
bulging biceps&#151;She knows!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is snoozing with Hugsy, his bedtime penguin
pal and Chandler and Monica come storming in.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Joey!</p>

<p>(Joey quickly tries to hide Hugsy by throwing it over his head.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe knows about us!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well <b>I</b> didn't tell them!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Them?! Who's them?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh man!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that
you know they know and <b>I</b> can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Unless&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! Not unless! Look this must end now!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh man, they think they are so <b>slick</b> messing with us! But see
they don't know that we know that they know! So&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is looking at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment through
binoculars.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Noooo.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none
of them even compares to that one!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know what you should do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with
him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or
my underwear.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm listening.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Ross) See?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been
watching him for like five years so <b>that</b> gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now
he had the trampoline.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He broke that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, he had gravity boots.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, he broke those too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So he likes to break stuff.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He
opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Right. (Exits.)</p>

<p>(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To
Phoebe) It's Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the
phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Eh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I
wasn't intrigued.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come
over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are you kidding?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can not believe he would do that to Mon&#151;Whoa! (She stops suddenly
and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we
know?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They know you know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with
us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,
you can't say anything!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I couldn't even if I wanted too.</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, Ross is knocks on the door and Ugly Naked
Guy answers it. He's ugly. He's naked. And he's holding a huge jumbo soda.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who
applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but&#151;I'm
sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you.
Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica and Rachel and Phoebe are planning
their respective strategies to break the other pairing. Joey is not amused.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yeah!</p>

<p>[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All
right, I'm gonna go in.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right. Be sexy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (laughs) Please.</p>

<p>(She saunters over to Chandler with a mean pair of 'Come hither' eyes and she glares at
Monica.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (initially worried, but gets over it) Really?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual
intercourse.</p>

<p>(As she walks away, Chandler mouths a scream to Monica. How motions and mouths,
&quot;It's okay, it's okay.&quot;)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked
Guy has a naked friend!</p>

<p>(They all run over to the window.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is <b>our</b> friend! (Monica
covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's
shoulder.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Phoebe ready for her date.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Show time!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay! (She runs to get some.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He begrudgingly does
so.)</p>

<p>(In the meantime, Rachel has returned with the perfume and sprays a mist out in front
of Phoebe who walks through the mist and does a little spin.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Monica is getting Chandler ready for his half of
the plan.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex
with her! It'll totally freak her out!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How do you know?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> At this?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the hallway, Phoebe is outside getting some last minute instructions from
Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from
right here!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good idea! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.) </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh now, don't give away the farm!</p>

<p>(Phoebe knocks on the door with the wine and Chandler answers it. Rachel hides next to
the door.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on in.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought
some wine. Would you like some?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure.</p>

<p>(She makes a big show out of pulling out the cork and pours the wine.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, here we are. Nervous?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Me? No. You?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I want this to happen.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So do I.</p>

<p>(They click their glasses and take a sip. That sip turns into a gulp, which quickly
progresses into their mutual draining of their glasses at once.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm gonna put on some music.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive
and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You look good.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip
that sweater vest right off!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, do you not want to?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have
you rub lotion on me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.</p>

<p>[Cut to the bathroom, Chandler is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put
lotion on her! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> She's bluffing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little
mimic of her dance.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is conferring with Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my
chair!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over and out in the open.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!
Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn&#146;t rip off any buttons.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's not my first time.</p>

<p>[Cut to the bathroom.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Of course.</p>

<p>[Cut back to the living room. Chandler slowly exits the bathroom and gets pushed from
behind by Monica and sees Phoebe closing the apartment door.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, you're-you're going?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is
showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were
gonna be having all the sex.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Not if I kiss you first.</p>

<p>(They move closer to together and Phoebe hesitantly puts her hand on Chandler's hip. He
puts his hand on her left hip but then decides to put his hand on her left hip. Phoebe
then grabs his butt. Chandler goes for her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her
shoulder.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Here it comes. Our first kiss.</p>

<p>(They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her
eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is squinting. He finally breaks the kiss after only a
short while and pushes Phoebe away.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And why not?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because I'm in love with Monica!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You're-you're what?!</p>

<p>(Monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and Rachel and Joey both enter.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Love her! That's right, I&#133;LOVE&#133;HER!!! I love her!! (They
walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I just&#151;I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in
love!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say
your breasts are still showing.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God! (She turns and buttons up.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well actually, Ross doesn't.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.</p>

<p>(Joey suddenly gets very angry.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's new apartment, he is showing his boss, Dr. Ledbetter his new place and
new outlook on life.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work
over once it's y'know, furnished.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Ledbetter:</b> I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Ledbetter:</b> I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to
work. I&#151;What? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh&#133; What are you
doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) <b>GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b> </p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway, Ross is running up the stairs. Note: This show continues where the
last one left off.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped
by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)
Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were
doing to my sister! Now get out here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five
months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care,
bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I'm going on the lamb.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross
is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To
Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?</p>

<p>(Ross spots Chandler and starts chasing him around the kitchen table. Chandler runs and
hides behind Monica.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What the hell are doing?!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's
going on?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I think, I <b>think</b> Ross knows about me and Monica.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (panicking) Dude! He's right there!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My
best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love
with her.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's
true, I love him too.</p>

<p>(There's a brief pause.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs
them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big
news!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.</p>

<p>(There's another pause as Ross gets angry again.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the
door.) You <b>all</b> knew and you didn't tell me?!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going
to react.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going
to react? (He hugs them both.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let
these two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.)
Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (quickly) I call Godfather!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You can't just <b>call</b> Godfather. Don't you think her brother should
be Godfather?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(A girl enters.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So, are you ready to go?</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Hey, where are we going to lunch?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I was thinking Chinese food.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Ohh, I <b>love</b> Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?! (She hits
him repeatedly as she says that.)</p>

<p>(She heads to the bathroom and Joey sits back down.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (shyly) She keeps punching me.</p>

<p>(They all laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's
hurting me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing
after preschool?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is
beating him up.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must
be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, he's unpacking after moving in. There's a knock on the door
and he answers it.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Aww.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bread, so you never go hungry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p>(The door across the hall opens and a guy walks into Ross's apartment.)</p>
<b>

<p>Guy:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>
<b>

<p>Guy:</b> Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants
committee.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Oh hi Phoebe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Mr. President.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> I came to talk to you about Howard.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Howard?</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone
who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of
thing.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh that's nice.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. Uhh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it
under my door. (Points to his apartment across the hall.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no, it's not that, it's just&#133; I-I <b>just</b> moved in.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Oh, okay, I get it. (Starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even <b>met</b>
Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Howard's the <b>handy</b> man!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes but too me he's just, man.</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. I really like his glasses.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross is lamenting to Chandler and Rachel about his
troubles in his new building.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> &#133;so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and
now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit
them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy
who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you
just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta
run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I
don't want you putting any ideas in her head.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, Chandler, you <b>do</b> realize that those ideas are probably
already in Monica's head.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wh-wh-why?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, because she loves you and because you love her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already
know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's
a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one
that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then
the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what <b>she</b> wants?!
I&#146;m right. I'm right. Am I right?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that
makes everything different.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. It's not different at all, is it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Not unless different means the same.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is sitting on the couch with Katie.]</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! (She slaps her
thighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again and
he retreats to the arm of the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like
you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully
punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very <b>real</b>
bat.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun
of me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the
couch.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Monica are curled up on one of the chairs.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Isn't this great?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.)
Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What-what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that
I'm seeing casually.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around
about marriage and stuff.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you <b>do</b> want all that stuff, right?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh and <b>you</b> know what I want!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I do not have baby fever!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and
everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn
down the heat on this pressure cooker?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about
you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the
head--in your head!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel
tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And
did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I did not know that.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is getting advice from Ross and Joey.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is,
this is fixable.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross and <b>Joey:</b></b> Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> By me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, no!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, big!</p>

<p>(Monica enters.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how
to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna
have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be
in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)</p>

<p>(Chandler turns to watch her go and then sees Ross and Joey both with huge grimaces on
their faces.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, he's having his party, only he's the only guest. He gets up
and puts on a nametag that says Ross, but doesn't quite like it. So he takes it off and
puts on one that says Dr. Geller and he puts the Ross one underneath the Dr. Geller one.
Then as he turns off the music, we hear the party for Howard raging in the apartment
across the hall.]</p>
<b>

<p>Party Guests:</b> (chanting) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (Ross goes to investigate
the noise) Howard! Howard! Howard! (They're holding Howard above their heads.) Howard!
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (He sees Phoebe chanting along with them.) Howard! Howard!
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hi Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it&#146;s a party for
Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)</p>

<p><b>Guest #1:</b> See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You chipped in?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was
totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the
exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but you're making me look bad!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you
talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> (walking up) Oh hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch
apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about. (Walks
away.)</p>

<p>(Ross turns and glares at Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, okay, my bad.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is getting some coffee as Joey enters. He's looking a
little puffy, but that's probably from the large number of different color sweaters he's
wearing.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Wow! You look, you look&#133;big.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing
six sweaters?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well look, I&#146;m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra
padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's
gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Hiya!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Hey, cute jacket!</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Oh, thanks! That's so sweet! (She punches Rachel like she punched Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, &quot;You see what I mean?!&quot;)</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, (Punches Joey) are too
much! (Punches Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are
the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends! (She punches Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> You're so sweet! (Punches Rachel yet again.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Well? Aren't you gonna do something?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh&#133;.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now!
Well? Are you gonna?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nah.</p>

<p>(She looks at Rachel and storms out. After she's left Joey hugs Rachel in thanks.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Howard's party, Phoebe is talking Ross up to two more partygoers. Ross isn't
happy about it.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (trying to get her attention) Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying.
(Laughs.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh. (Turns to him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all
right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?</p>

<p>(They go to the food table.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So uh, what did you tell them about me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some
sympathy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But somehow you came off as the bad guy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because
I don't totally understand what happened there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!</p>

<p><b>Guest #2:</b> (sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross tries
dumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a think like that?</p>

<p>(Steve goes over to look at Ross who's trying to look cool, but has some frosting on
his lip.)</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> 3-B!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Oh yeah, aww!</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think
it's time you went home?!</p>

<p><b>Guest #3:</b> Yeah, leave!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah, get out! Now!</p>

<p><b>Steve:</b> Go back to 3-B, 3-B!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that
I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and
Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he
didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, &quot;Who hear likes
Ross,&quot; and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you
guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I
saw that he's really sweet and caring and <b>very</b> generous. I mean, all I'm saying is
don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now,
but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind
numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something
woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv!
So, I think you all know what I mean.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross and Phoebe have been banished to Ross's place.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just
thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you
could look like the hero.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler comes running in. Everyone else is already
there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is
she here?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (raising her hand) I'm Monica.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I need to talk to you, it's urgent!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh,
us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and
awkwardly gets down on one knee.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (getting out a ring box) Monica&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Will you marry me?</p>

<p>(Phoebe hides her eyes in shame. Rachel is starring at them wide-eyed and open-mouthed.
Joey and Ross are stunned to temporary silence.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-no. No. No.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What a bad idea!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, why are you doing this?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm doing this because I'm sorry?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because
you're sorry?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much
fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually <b>wanting</b> to get married. (Laughs.)
Will you be my wife?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I
want you to think about how <b>ridiculous</b> this sounds.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never
said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these
guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Who? Two divorces and Joey?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She's right y'know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but still, cheap shot!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this
relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I didn't think I was!</p>

<p>(They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the
rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole
in that door. (Points at the door.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Everyone is there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I will not!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?</p>

<p>(They all laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to
you last week.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to
move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, how long is this going to go on.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you
were so, a long time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole &quot;We were on a break
thing?&quot; Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is
laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's not funny.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's not funny at all!</p>

<p>(They all get up and leave.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Monica and Chandler are sitting on one of the chairs doing
a crossword puzzle.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you guys doing up?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do
you know a six-letter word for red?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (thinks) Dark red.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for
you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Aww, you guys are so cute!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I'll see you in the morning.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler and <b>Monica:</b></b> Okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's bedroom, time lapse. He's asleep and dreaming. In his dream he's doing
the crossword puzzle with&#133;wait for it&#133;Monica!]</p>
<b>

<p>Dream <b>Monica:</b></b> Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!</p>
<b>

<p>Dream <b>Joey:</b></b> Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.</p>
<b>

<p>Dream <b>Monica:</b> </b>Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog
but&#133;</p>
<b>

<p>Dream <b>Joey:</b></b> Cat.</p>
<b>

<p>Dream <b>Monica:</b></b> Yes! You are so smart! (Kisses him.) I love you.</p>
<b>

<p>Dream <b>Joey:</b></b> I love you too.</p>

<p>(They hug.)</p>

<p>[Cut back to Joey in bed, he's smiling, enjoying the dream as he wakes up. Suddenly, he
realized what he was dreaming about and bolts upright in bed.]</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there but Ross and Joey. Gunther hands them the bill,
and Chandler gives some money to pay it.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel!
(Donates it.) How much more do we need?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> A couple of bucks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this
could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh
my God, this is a police badge!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't
serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I
think I can come up with something better than that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm
at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy
has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in
hope.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey, you guys!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey Joey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's
sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I&#146;m not him.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you saying I smell bad?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the
bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What's with him?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was
shot by a hunter.</p>

<p>[Scene: A couch store, Ross is trying to decide on a new couch for his place. He has
dragged Rachel along for the trip, and she's not too happy about it. Ross is sitting on it
in different ways to see how it feels. He tries to just sit on it normally, and then he
tries flopping on it. One thing about this couch, it's huge. It's like twice the size of a
normal full size couch. Whoever designed this thing, needs help and fast.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hovering
nearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch
that says, &quot;Kids welcome here.&quot; But that also says, (In a sexy voice) &quot;Come
here to me!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! You say that to kids?!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! No! The &quot;Come here to me&quot; is y'know for the ladies.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.</p>

<p><b>The Salesman:</b> You picked a great couch.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>The Salesman:</b> Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? (Hands him a
clipboard.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as
the couch!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and
hands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the
couch.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting
her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it!
Come on! Come on!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her
amazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>The Salesman:</b> You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the
store.)</p>

<p><b>The Salesman:</b> Ohh, okay. (Laughs.) Something didn't quite add up there. (Ross
stops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes Rachel up against a
wall.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's that supposed to mean?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross!</p>

<p><b>The Salesman:</b> Well you, her, I mean, she's very&#133;y'know. And you're
like&#133;y'know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not that it's any of your business, but we <b>did</b> go out.</p>

<p><b>The Salesman:</b> Really? You two?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! Rach?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a
very heavy couch.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Then tell him quickly.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are <b>such</b> a loser!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!</p>

<p>(Rachel pushes on the couch and pushes Ross out the door.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside of Central Perk, Phoebe is exiting and sees a woman put out her
cigarette on a tree.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? </p>

<p><b>The Smoking Woman:</b> Yes?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!</p>

<p><b>The Smoking Woman:</b> Yeah I can, it worked real well.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.</p>

<p><b>The Smoking Woman:</b> I won't! (Turns away) Until I have my next cigarette.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!</p>

<p><b>The Smoking Woman:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book
'em.</p>

<p><b>The Smoking Woman:</b> Who are you talking too?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you
apologize to the tree.</p>

<p><b>The Smoking Woman:</b> I am <b>not</b> going to apologize to a tree!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The
woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!</p>

<p><b>The Smoking Woman:</b> I-I'm sorry! Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's building's lobby, he and Rachel are about to attempt to take the couch
upstairs.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.</p>

<p>(They start the attempt. Ross is going backwards and reaches the first landing. This
staircase has three steps then a landing, makes a 90-degree turn, and has more steps
before another landing and another 90-degree turn.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the
railing.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!
You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.
You got it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Good-good-good. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh! </p>

<p>(She can't stay at the end as the couch rounds the turn so she shifts to the back
corner of the couch and is at a 90-degree angle to it.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it? </p>

<p>(She don't got it as the couch slips out of their grips and falls over the bottom
railing.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Any chance you think the couch looks good there?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is telling Chandler and Monica how she fought crime
in her own way with the badge she found.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &#133;so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.
(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could
get arrested.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at
her.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for
the door just as Joey enters.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Joey) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, Joe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I didn&#146;t know you guys were going to be here.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (backing away) What?! Why?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is going on with you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nothing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't
want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said
that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I
don&#146;t want to talk about it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, it involved Monica.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!
(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.
(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I
love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt
about her like that since I found out about you two--ish. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What was the dream about?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and <b>we</b> were doing the crossword
puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica
and I'll be moving out.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn&#146;t mean that-that you're in love with
me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It-it doesn&#146;t?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous
because I've become the apartment stud.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That kinda sounds like your dream dude.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we
y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Um-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are
you attracted to her?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (looks at her) Not really.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well there you have it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly
realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you
just want a girlfriend!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I
mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but
y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well y'know, Monica and I were <b>friends</b> before we started
dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Friends first? That's interesting.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You become friends after?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, never done that either.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.</p>

<p>(Monica and Chandler both remember a special moment between them.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughing) That's right.</p>

<p>(They realize the implication of their behavior, stop instantly and head for his
bedroom. In the meanwhile, Joey is starring at Rachel in a seductive way.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (noticing him) What's up Joey?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (in a sexy voice) How you doin'?</p>

<p>(Rachel is stunned.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Phoebe is walking up and notices a car that is parked
half on the curb and right in front of the door, making it difficult for people to enter
Central Perk.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Excuse me, is this your car?</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're
blocking the entrance. </p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause
I'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)</p>

<p><b>Guy:</b> (he reaches into the car and slams his siren on the roof.) So am I!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park
anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.
10-4. (Tries to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> (stopping her) Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I'm with the umm, the 57<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> Who-who else is in vice up there?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> No, I don't know him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (starts to walk away, but stops) Don&#146;t try to call him or anything,
'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> (following her) Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I
heard that kid from <i>Silver Spoons</i> is really good. (Phoebe's stunned) And where did
you find my badge?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs
away.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering. Rachel is there getting some tools to
help Ross out.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can
blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you.</p>

<p>(He starts staring at her longingly.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking
to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm
thinking of getting me one of those.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What's up Joe?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> &#133;is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself,
&quot;Who are my friends?&quot; You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughing) What are you saying?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me
first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm&#133; No
honey, listen I think it's a <b>great</b> idea to become friends with someone before you
date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend,
build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Won't-won't that take longer?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's <b>so </b>worth the wait.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) <b>Man</b>, I wish I saw Phoebe
first!</p>

<p>[Scene: The lobby of Ross's building, he's sitting on the couch at the bottom of the
stairs, and he's practicing enticing women to join him on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh great! What, you brought Joey?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I brought the next best thing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Okay
Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.) </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, that's me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! That's-that's my arm!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really
liked your new couch.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead. </p>

<p>(Chandler and Ross head for opposite ends of the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, Chandler. </p>

<p>(They pick up the couch and after throwing off the last pillow; Rachel helps out on
Chandler's end.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!</p>

<p>(Chandler has moved forward and is now underneath the couch as it heads up the first

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, ready?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Turn.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (straining) Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Turn! Turn!</p>

<p>(As they turn the couch, Chandler gets sandwiched between the railing and the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They
start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot!
Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!</p>

<p>(They set the couch down.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler and <b>Rachel:</b></b> You think?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.</p>

<p>(As they start back down the couch drops a little bit and gets jammed. They try to free
it to no avail.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I can't believe that didn't work!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, me neither! I mean, you <b>had</b> a sketch!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is returning and finds Chandler, Monica, and Rachel
are there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, well, she's&#133;really good in bed.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! Why?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As
soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I
suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her
roommate!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What about the closeness?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering with a pizza and finds everyone but Ross
there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, I do! I do! I do!</p>

<p>(They all walk over to get a slice.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
</p>

<p>(They all throw their pieces back as there is a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Who is it?</p>
<b>

<p>Voice:</b> N.Y.P.D!!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe and <b>Joey:</b></b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, just a minute officer!! </p>

<p>(He throws his piece back in the box, runs into the living room, looks for a place to
hide the pizza, finds one, slides the box under the couch, sits down on the table, and
tries to quickly chew the food in his mouth.)</p>
<b>

<p><b>Cop:</b></b> I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me.
(They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck
Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But
you'll never make it stick and you know it!</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand
right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once
he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you
today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I would <b>love</b> it if I weren't here!</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you
would like to go to dinner with me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Me?!</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking
about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler and <b>Joey:</b></b> Nice!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer&#133;</p>

<p><b>Cop:</b> Gary.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Gary.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Okay, so it's a date.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find
me?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through
the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, impressive.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and
you've done some pretty weird stuff.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Okay. (He starts to leave.) So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you
up?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I can't wait!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.</p>

<p>(Chandler busts out laughing and everyone just looks at him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Rachel) He <b>has</b> a gun!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The couch store, Ross is talking to a saleswoman.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.</p>

<p>[The camera cuts to show the couch, which has been cut in half.]</p>

<p><b>The Saleswoman:</b> You wanna return this couch? (Ross nods yes.) It's cut in half!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That's what I'm telling you.</p>

<p><b>The Saleswoman:</b> Did you cut this couch in half?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This couch, is cut in <b>half</b>! I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half!</p>

<p><b>The Saleswoman:</b> You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I am a reasonable man. I <b>will</b> accept store credit.</p>

<p><b>The Saleswoman:</b> I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (thinks) I take it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there as Rachel enters, happily.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good, you guys are all here!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! What's up?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I have a job interview at <i>Ralph Lauren</i> tomorrow!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wh-what?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for
excess anything in there.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll
work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You wanna work on your interview skills?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> O-okay!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi. </p>

<p>(They shake hands.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Very good handshake, good wrist action.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did
I ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did I squeeze it too hard?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.</p>

<p>(Chandler tries to comprehend that remark.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is standing at the window waving at Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see
me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. </p>

<p>(We see Ross through the window and he acts like a swimmer that gets attacked by a
shark, picture one of the many, many, many <i>Jaws</i> movies they made and you get the
idea.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a
woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.)
(Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in
Ross's building is flirting with me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here
goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does
a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She
smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.)
Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no,
I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica
away and makes a disgusted face.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's Building, Joey is trying to find the hot girl's apartment. So he's
walking up the hallway counting doors. He comes to what he thinks is the right one and
knocks on it. Ross opens the door, it's his apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> This is your place?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can
pretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering again.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ugh!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.
(Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his
'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on
his remote.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV. </p>

<p>(It's only when the camera cuts to Ross's apartment that we see that the TV is turned
off and Ross is indeed doing a bit. He then tries to hide his smirk.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, later that day, Gary is kissing Phoebe good-bye.]</p>

<p><strong>Gary's Radio: </strong>We've lost visual contact with the suspect.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Okay, now I've really have to go!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause
some guy shot at a store clerk.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> I know, but it's my job, sweethart!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, then maybe I can come too!</p>

<p><strong>Gary's Radio: </strong>Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, you go. (They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Bye-bye.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> 'Kay, bye!</p>

<p>(Gary closes the door behind him.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh I just miss him so much!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this
little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just <b>love</b>
beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each
other.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know it is the best.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What? It's still going on.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, seriously! When did it end?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you
just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don&#146;t you just get all your facts before you
run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was <b>wrong</b>
obviously, I just&#151;I misspoke. It's okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no, it <b>is</b> okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I
are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next day, Chandler and Joey are there as Rachel
returns from her interview.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh hey, how'd the interview go?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall
right out of your chair?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So what happened?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I
even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, &quot;Well, yeah! If
you've got enough life jackets!&quot; (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not
amused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye
and ugh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we
were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me&#133; Y'know maybe he was going to open
the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh&#133; (The flashback shows that she
kissed him on the cheek.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You kissed him?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I didn't know what else to do!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from <i>Ralph Lauren</i>
called, you got a second interview!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can't believe it! I got a second interview!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> A kiss? What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back
y'know of course, 'cause &quot;Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, Rach.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just
sleep with him?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Maybe. I-I don't know&#151;Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey.
Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's
back!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the
window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.
(He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes
something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and
kisses her.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's building, Joey is knocking on a door again. It's again answered by
Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Damnit!! Did you move?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey
just stares at him) I'm Ross.</p>

<p>(Joey makes a frustrated face and noise and walks away. He knocks on the next door and
it's answered by an old man.)</p>

<p><b>The Old Man:</b> Yes?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?</p>

<p><b>The Old Man:</b> No. I'm all alone.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which
is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or
babysitter by any chance a hot girl?</p>

<p><b>The Little Girl:</b> Daddy!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole
other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel's job interview, she is waiting outside Mr. Zelner's (the interviewer)
office banging her pen between her teeth.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> Hi Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> Come on in.</p>

<p>(They go inside.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> It's really nice to see you again.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> (Sees that she has some ink on her lip from her pen.) Oh Rachel,
uhh&#133; (He points to his lip to get her to notice the ink on hers.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> Just ah&#133; (He points again.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> Here let me&#133; (He goes to wipe it off himself.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going
on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am <b>not</b>
some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to
interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does
not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, <b>this</b> job <b>that</b>
bad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning from her interview attempt.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Ugh, you will not <b>believe</b> what that sleaze-ball from <i>Ralph
Lauren</i> did too me!</p>

<p>(Joey, Monica, and Ross all point to their lips to get Rachel to once again notice the
ink on her lip.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You got ink on your lip.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh&#133;.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Gary and Chandler and Monica are all there.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you&#133; (He gestures and spills
some of his coffee.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Yeah, I'm gonna say no.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh we can't, we already have plans.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so
amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck <b>is</b>
that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not
seeing a movie!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and
Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you
for a second?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have <b>got</b> to beat
them! {Here we go yet again.}</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohh, so?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them
wrong!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica, you have <b>got</b> to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's
crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go
upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The lobby in Ross's building, we see a flyer that is on the bulletin board that
reads, &quot;Are you the Hot Girl who waved at me? If so, give me a call!&quot; and it's
signed, Joey 629-9*** (The last couple of numbers have been ripped off). Anyhoo, Ross is
getting his mail.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!</p>

<p>(A man walks up.)</p>

<p><b>The Man:</b> (To Ross) Excuse me. (He puts up a flyer that has a sketch drawing of
Joey and it reads, &quot;Warning! Intruder! If you see this creep - call the cops!&quot;)
You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking
for some kind of a hot girl.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't? </p>

<p>(For the first time we see that the woman Ross is talking too is in fact the hot girl
that Joey is looking for. She just kinda stares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.</p>

<p><b>The Hot Girl:</b> I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nevermind! (Goes back to his mailbox.)</p>

<p><b>The Hot Girl:</b> No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I
mean you had just moved in.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I <b>had</b> just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm&#133;</p>

<p><b>The Hot Girl:</b> Jen.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Jen, I know this may sound a little&#133;(makes some kind of crazy noise)
But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or&#133;</p>

<p><b>Jen:</b> Sure! That would be nice.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm?</p>

<p><b>Jen:</b> Oh! My number is on there. (Hands him a business card.) Give me a call.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I will give you a call.</p>

<p><b>Jen:</b> I'll see you later. (Starts to walk away.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay!</p>

<p>(After she's left, Ross gets really happy and starts kissing the card. Suddenly, she
returns.)</p>

<p><b>Jen:</b> I forgot my paper. (Ross quickly hides the card in his mouth.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, a post-coital Monica and Chandler are recovering on the
couch.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That was amazing!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe and Gary are <b>so</b> gonna hear about this at dinner.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That was amazing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We are the hottest! Huh? <b>No one</b> is hotter than we are! You're the
best.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, you're the best.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, you're the best.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, you're the best.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I <b>am</b> the best.</p>

<p>(Just as they start to get up, Joey walks in.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'?
(Has a silly grin.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you
the other day?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.)
Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her
anyway.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of
hot girl parallel universe, or something.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously
lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No. No. No. She lives on the <b>third</b> floor, <b>eighth</b> apartment
from the left.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the
other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I did <b>not</b> know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't
believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.</p>

<p>[Scene: Jen's apartment, Ross is picking her up for their date.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So uhh, you ready?</p>

<p><b>Jen:</b> Sure, I'll just get my coat. (There's a knock on the door.) Could you get
that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.)
Joey&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Mr. Zelner's office, Rachel has come back again to try and do that second
interview.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this
meeting is being videotaped.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to
start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> Fair enough.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She
puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put
her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big
mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage.
When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.
And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes
that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you
gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in
the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to
litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.&nbsp; So she didn't want to sue him.
&nbsp; Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts
them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and
not litigious. Look Mr&#133;</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> Zelner.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think,
I think I would be really good at it.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (gasps) Oh! You are?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> Um-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really? Oh thank you! Oh&#133; Oh, would it be completely inappropriate
to give you a hug?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Zelner:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but
misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to
touch that&#151;I mean <b>you</b> there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going
to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so&#151;Hey! I'll see you Monday!
(Exits.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A restaurant, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Gary are on a double date. Chandler
is yawning.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You tired Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I
mean. You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the
lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee.
(Heads for the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You didn't!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The park huh? A public place.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the
bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the Men's room. Chandler is practicing flashing his badge as Monica enters.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.
Haven't you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is
getting ridiculous!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on, we <b>can't</b> let them win!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you
getting so obsessed about this thing?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because Phoebe and Gary are in
that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (gasps) So?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I feel really sad that we're not&#133;really there anymore.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other
all the time?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth,
I'm more excited about where we are right now.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long
before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I
think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I
think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I
feel the same way.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. (They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our
relationship.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Did not.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I freaked out a little.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have
switched places! <b>I</b> am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational
screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Looking through Ross's window, he's doing more pantomimes. The first one is
he's walking a dog that has stopped, then suddenly tugs him forward.]</p>

<p>[Cut to the inside of Monica and Rachel's apartment, Monica and Rachel are sitting at
the table.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) You guys ready fore the movies?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. </p>

<p>(We see through the big window from the outside and see that Monica and Rachel have
pictures of their faces pasted onto cardboard cutouts of Pamela Anderson and Yasmine
Bleeth wearing their <i>Baywatch</i> swimsuits.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot
and waves at the cutouts.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there. Joey is holding a
deck of cards out to Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, pick a card.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pause) Yes. </p>

<p>(Joey laughs then realizes the trick didn't work when Chandler hands him his card
back.) </p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (entering with Ben and Ross) Hey guys!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi there!</p>

<p><b>Ben:</b> Hi!!</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you talking about?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the
park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave
us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting
director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!
(Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go
Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million
times and no one offered me an audition.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I'm <b>always</b> on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Opening Credits</p>
</b>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is eating breakfast, Ross is heading for the
bathroom.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Luck!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey Rach, now that you're working at <i>Ralph Lauren</i>, can you
bring me back some of those polo shirts?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my
very <b>first</b> day&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay guys, way to wish me luck!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Good luck! Go get 'em! (Rachel exits.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party
this weekend.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a
surprise.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just
invite her close friends.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (from the bathroom) Okay!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Done.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, great so do you want to do it together?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I would love to do it together!</p>

<p>(Joey starts to giggle.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They're gonna do it together.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Dude! That's my girlfriend!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What, so I gotta shut it down now?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big
audition.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in
agreement.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an
audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're not his godfather.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! Are you kidding?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!</p>

<p>(As they walk out he motions to Chandler that he is still Ben's godfather.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ben's audition, Carol, Ross, and Ben along with about 10 more families are in a
waiting room as Joey enters happily.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really? That's great!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually
seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her&#133;</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of <i>Variety</i> to read) Hey,
that kid looks familiar.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar
Smacks, <i>Playstation</i>, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in
that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad&#133;.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I
mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's
dad?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey, you look nothing like Ben.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel's new job, she's in her new boss's office (Kim's) and with the other
assistant (Nancy). Together they're deciding what clothes to buy or something, who knows,
let's all watch/read to find out.]</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I
agree. Rachel, what do you think?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On
the other one.) Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and
then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.</p>

<p><b>Nancy:</b> She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm
kidding!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you
say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?</p>

<p>(They all get up to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> (at the door) Rachel? Do you smoke?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror
stories&#133;(stops and tries to change directions)&#133;about ghosts and goblins who
totally supported the princess's right to smoke.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is telling Chandler and Monica about her day.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> &#133;and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the
decisions without me!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That doesn't seem fair.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting,
poisoning habit!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it is the best.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside
smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid
clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do
you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you
wanna get some fresh air.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I can do that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I would love to!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh good!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I wanna go to babe.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh good.</p>

<p>(They all start out.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's
talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look at that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus,
umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music,
here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really
good with the food.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What happened to the intimate dinner party?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, we're not doing that. Okay&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot,
co-host.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of
things for you to do!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Like what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (Thinks) Cups.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Cups? You're giving me cups?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And ice!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of
something) All right. Fine, okay, I <b>will</b> be in charge of cups and ice!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I got it! Mine!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering, downtrodden) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey! How'd the audition go?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not so good.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) &quot;Audition didn't go so
well. (Happily) Yeah it did?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually
didn't get a callback.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You got a callback too didn't you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (Happily) Yeah I did!</p>

<p>[Scene: The smoker's balcony, Rachel is out to join Kim and Nancy.]</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out
here and get some fresh air.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh great!</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> So anyway we really&#133; (Someone exhales and Rachel turns and coughs.)
Honey, we're just smoking all over you.</p>

<p><b>Nancy:</b> Oh, sorry!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh that's okay.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. (They walk away.)</p>

<p><b>Nancy:</b> So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about
the line.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Oh that's great! You are the best!</p>

<p>(Rachel gets fed up and heads over to another smoker.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know
what, actually&#133; (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim
are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?</p>

<p><b>Nancy:</b> I thought you didn't smoke.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I
mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, &quot;Wow, those guys are
crazy!&quot; But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> We get high.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, me too.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> I'm kidding.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Laughs) Oh, me too.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ben and Joey's (Isn't that an ice cream??) callback.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who knows?</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> (entering) Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond,
Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long!
Later!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have
such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either
you two (Points to Joey and Raymond) or you two. (Points to Kyle and Ben.) (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><strong>Kyle: </strong>Yeah. It's gonna be weird.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.</p>

<p><strong>Kyle: </strong>Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are talking.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross and <b>Chandler:</b></b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah sure. What's in 'em?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, cups.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Seriously that's a lot of cups.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and
Monica is gonna <b>rue the day</b> that she put me in charge of cups and ice.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know I rued the day once&#133;didn't get a whole lot else done.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the
door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me
going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I
think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career
we're talking about here!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, you just&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone
should step aside it should be Ben!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Chandler! Tell 'em!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the
door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you
just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> At least I care about his feelings!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn&#146;t get it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And why wouldn't he get it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, come on! Have you <b>seen</b> what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he
dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You just give him a spoon baby!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're kid's name is Raymond!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah?! So's yours!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Rachel) How did work go?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said,
y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You stink!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, I'm-I'm serious!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.
This is actually the smell of success.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I did not!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I wish I had smoked for my career&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's so gross!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a
little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm
not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The smoker's balcony, Rachel, Kim, and Nancy are all puffing away on their
cancer sticks.]</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?</p>

<p><b>Nancy:</b> Absolutely!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Rachel didn't you just light that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back,
y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.</p>

<p><b>Nancy:</b> I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every
Monday morning it's like (Mimics chain smoking.)</p>

<p><b>Nancy:</b> Tell me about it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> It does sound appealing.</p>

<p><b>Nancy:</b> Oh, I never could do it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We
can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their
cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> My late husband gave me that lighter. (Rachel laughs.) I'm not kidding.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's
lighter.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Ben's audition, Joey is rehearsing his lines, uh correction, Joey is
rehearsing his <b>line</b>.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) <b>Hmm</b> soup! (Tries again, with a little
caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for
me while I use the ladies' room?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, no problem.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Thanks. (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya,
it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. <b>No</b> stability. One day you're Dr. Drake
Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering, angrily) Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (angrily) Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> (entering) Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.</p>

<p>(Raymond and Joey go in the office.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
(Some dude puts down a couple bowls of soup in front of them.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh-oh.</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Is there a problem?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's
okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, &quot;Hmm,
soup.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, what did I say?</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Hmm, noodle soup.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> All right, let's try one.</p>

<p>(Raymond and Joey both eat a spoonful and Joey turns to Raymond and says&#133;)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hmm, noodle soup.</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Okay. Let's do it again.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(They do it again.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!</p>

<p><b>Raymond:</b> COME ON!!!!</p>

<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Y'know what? We need to move on.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful)
Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The smoker's balcony, Kim and Nancy are cheating and are caught by Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Uh-oh, busted!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Yeah. That didn't work out.</p>

<p><b>Nancy:</b> Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least
told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> No. No! You're doing great! Don&#146;t you give up! That's why we didn't
tell you and we're <b>not</b> gonna drag you down with us.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not
gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on,
get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (Starts to walk away.)</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> (to Nancy) So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (hearing that) Oh man!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel's surprise party. The apartment is festooned with
cups. There are cups everywhere! Cup centerpiece, cup garland, etc., etc]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner!
Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Great job with the cups, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!</p>

<p>(Chandler starts to follow her into the kitchen.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets
of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours
some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Awesome!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're
all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know&#133;go! Go! Right there! (Points)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)</p>

<p>(Rachel enters.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Surprise!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's the surprise!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean
Chandler's birthday is even before mine!</p>

<p>(Everyone stops and looks at Chandler, who's nodding.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Surprise!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I was in charge of cups.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay, not so weird.</p>

<p>[Cut to another part of the room, Ross is going to talk to Joey.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No really, I-I am! I feel bad!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck.
I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, &quot;Hmm, noodle soup.&quot; (Nods his head
in disgust.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you
suck, maybe you messed up because you care <b>more</b> about uh, your godson.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What you do mean?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think, sub-consciously&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that
Ben would get the part.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah.
Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was
more important to see him succeed.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There you go. Thank you!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you! So, did-did he get it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Eh, what are you gonna do?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The smoker's balcony, Kim and Nancy are out smoking as Chandler sticks his head
out the door.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was
supposed to meet her for lunch.</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, great.</p>

<p>(Kim exhales and Chandler stares at it longingly.)</p>

<p><b>Kim:</b> (to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette)
whole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would be
enough (Closer) to get a take on the trip (Still closer) and I said, &quot;Yeah,
absolutely!&quot; (She's interrupted by Chandler who has reached his goal and takes a drag
from her cancer stick.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is getting ready for a date with Monica as Ross
enters.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got
reservations at Ja George.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! How'd you get in there?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at
11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert. </p>

<p>(There's a knock on the door and Chandler answers it. It's the pizza delivery girl.)</p>
<b>

<p>Delivery Girl:</b> Hi Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a <b>lot</b> more
interesting.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> It's uh, 27 dollars even.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go. </p>

<p>(The duck starts quacking.)</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Hey, where's the chicken?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came
first.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> (laughs) Great. I'll see you later!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, bye!</p>

<p>(He closes the door and turns to see Ross glaring at him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What the hell was that?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm,
let's say my sister?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I was not flirting.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It was totally flirting. &quot;Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney,
nasally noises.)&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not
flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move
towards Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (backing away) I'm good.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are in the kitchen.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on <i>Law &amp;
Order</i>!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Don't get me started on that.</p>

<p>(Ross and Chandler enter with the pizzas.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I was not flirting.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And on your anniversary, for shame!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I was not and oh God, shh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting
on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sounds like somebody wants to be <b>Mr.</b> Pizza Delivery Girl.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?</p>

<p>(Ross looks at Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been <b>married</b> since then.
I think it's okay that we see other people.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hm-mmm.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay
Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when
she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You
remember my grandmother!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Big night!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is so cool!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, Joey on <i>Law &amp; Order</i>, you must be very proud!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just
stares at him.) I've done it again.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's
believed in me. </p>

<p>(They both start speaking Italian to each other, and since I'm not Italian and don't
understand one word, we'll move on to the English portion of the show. Not, that I'm
English. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that I'm not. Y'know I think
I should shut-up now and move on. Anyhoo, she says something about Joey being fat I think
based on this line.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in
London&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The one that doesn't.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (runs over to Phoebe) You have <b>got</b> to go home!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But I like it here!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay?
Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get
dressed and I'll look for them.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Great!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you
borrowed.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her
room.)</p>

<p>(Phoebe then gets possessed 'cause she starts speaking in tongues. She speaks Italian
to Joey's grandmother. She is quickly exorcised and returns to speaking in English. Of
course, too most people English is a strange language as well. But none of them are
probably reading this and if they were they wouldn't understand it. So why am I talking
about them? I have absolutely no clue. Moving on&#133;) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we
could really tell.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh what, you-you want both of them?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I
know it's in the apartment, but I <b>definitely</b> lost it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Tell her to wear her own earrings.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> These <b>are</b> her earrings.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow
her stuff!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because I lose her stuff!</p>

<p>[Time Lapse, the gang is now watching <i>Law &amp; Order</i>. By the way, the entire
rest of the episode takes place in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Why are they called
apartments when they're all stuck together? Something to think about.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.</p>

<p>(His grandmother asks him something.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If you said, &quot;Big lima bean, bubbling up.&quot; Would she
understand the difference?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's a diaper commercial.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!</p>

<p>(There's a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Pizza delivery!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like
8-year-old boys.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you
thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Oh. Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What's goin' on?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's no big deal, I do it all the time.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with
guys all the time?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean
anything with you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a <b>lot</b> hotter than
I am.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, this actually bothers you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people.
Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other
women?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And thank you, for that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never
very good at the flirting thing.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then <b>bamn</b>
nine years later you had me!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to
order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt.
Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> On your dresser.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay that is the one we already have!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops
on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if
she finds out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (smiling) Well, what is it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (smiling) What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (smiling) Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (smiling) Not likely.&nbsp; 'Cause you see that body bag right there</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (smiling) Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (smiling) I'm in it.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, it's continued from before the commercial break.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When
they dumped me off of <i>Days of Our Lives</i> she almost died.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (not smiling) That's not good.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all
smile.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your
fault.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out
soon?</p>

<p><b>Grandma Tribbiani:</b> (Something in Italian to Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of
course it isn't him.)</p>

<p><b>Grandma Tribbiani:</b> (pointing at the screen) No! Sam Waterston!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.</p>

<p><b>Grandma Tribbiani:</b> No, it's Sam Waterston! <i>Crimes and Misdemeanors</i>,<i>
Capricorn One</i>.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Doesn't know, &quot;Hello.&quot; But she knows <i>Capricorn One</i>.</p>

<p>(Phoebe gets up.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to
leave as soon as the show is over.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But I already gave them back to you!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No you didn't.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.
(Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's
last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!</p>

<p>(Rachel heads for Joey and Chandler's and Phoebe heads for the kitchen to find Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for
ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you like it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, that would be, &quot;Why are you being cute?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I'm working on my flirting.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh! I did not get that.</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler and Monica on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So uh Monica, do you, do you like the <i>Law &amp; Order</i>?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, it's good.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the
<i>Law &amp; Order</i> and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which
they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are
different for men and for women.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Go on, teach me something about men and women.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when
you flirt with a guy you think, &quot;I'm just flirting, no big deal.&quot; But the guy is
thinking, &quot;Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No way!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's true.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well that's pathetic!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Again true.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And this goes for all guys?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys
from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still
haven't told her!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch)
ten minutes left!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! You are <b>not</b> gonna run out and leave her here!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs
out before anyone can stop him.)</p>

<p><b>Grandma Tribbiani:</b> Joey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it
for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Rachel is coming back from Chandler and Joey's.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Did you find it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've
been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives
her the one-minute sign.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh that'd be great!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, what is it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it
you lost it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! You're the best!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen
honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent <b>me</b> the earrings, and I lost it.
I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (angrily) That is <b>exactly</b> why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel
looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's
not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Your sunglasses?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> (from outside) Pizza!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes.
Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I
don't flirting is the right thing to&#133; (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?</p>
<b>

<p>All:</b> Caitlin!</p>

<p><b>Grandma Tribbiani:</b> Caitlin!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating
like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> It's uh, $12.50.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh,
wood-burning ovens?</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Gas? Wow! Intense.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a
problem.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> (wanting more than anything to get the money and leave this horrible,
horrible place) Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> They put that in.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a
leak.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> (getting more desperate to leave) Well okay!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> A lot of other gas smells&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh the humanity.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Meth-methane smells&#133;</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one
is on me! (Runs for her life.)</p>

<p>(Ross closes the door slowly.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To All) Was I talking to her about gas?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> More so than anything else.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I-I found it interesting.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will
be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple
of the old pizza boxes and exits.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (walking over to Ross) Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What else do they add smell too?</p>

<p>[Scene: The street outside the building, Rachel is running to catch up with Caitlin.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs?
The ones with all the pizza?</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Oh, is there a problem?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually
umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Oh my God! That was flirting?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past
that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> The guy with the gas?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and
he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?</p>

<p><b>Caitlin:</b> I just, I thought Joey was there.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey's grandmother are still
watching <i>Law &amp; Order</i>.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and
uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
(Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And she just gave you this?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well that I can believe.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yay!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey! Is the show still on?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Almost over man.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the
Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why am I looking?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!</p>

<p>(Joey has made a little home movie that's his big scene. He braces himself against the
door to his apartment and while holding a plastic gun and wearing the same sweater
says&#133;)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!</p>

<p><b>Grandma Tribbiani:</b> Oh Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's right!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The
duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000
in small bills, and if I don't get it&#133;(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't
get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the
gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!</p>

<p><b>Grandma Tribbiani:</b> Joey, bravo! (Starts with that Italian stuff again.)</p>

<p>(Suddenly, the tape cuts away from Joey's impromptu scene, to Chandler standing really,
really close to the camera.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (singing) <i>Ground control to Major Tom</i>! <i>Commencing
countdown&#133;engines&#133;on</i>!</p>

<p>(Joey and Chandler both run to shut off the tape.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I am <b>definitely</b> gonna watch that!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, another time lapse, Monica is seeking advice from Rachel
and Phoebe about possible replacement earrings.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What about these? These look the same?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Definitely!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Not as each other! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, then no.</p>

<p>(Goes over to Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You ready?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Let me see the earrings.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, honey, the earrings&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best
taste or what?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> My boyfriend really does have good taste!</p>

<p>(He turns to get his coat and Monica gives Rachel and Phoebe two thumbs up as Chandler
walks over to Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hm-mmm.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Rachel, Joey, and Monica are sitting on the couch as
Ross is up getting some coffee.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily
gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, good idea.</p>

<p>(Ross returns.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey man, what's up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married
tomorrow. (Joey panics.) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, Ross, look! Look! (Points behind Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (turning and looking) What? Where?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What am I looking at?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering, with Gary) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Hello!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> How are you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he
let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You got to go on a ride along?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I want to go on a ride along!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Me too!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, yeah! Me too!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Really?! You?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Well, it's kinda dangerous.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I like danger.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Okay, you guys free tonight?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey and <b>Ross:</b></b> Yeah!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is kneeling at the coffee table and has a bunch of
pictures laid out in front of her as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could <b>finally</b>
organize these photos!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, thank God! <b>Finally</b>!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got
holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know&#133; And then what I've done is I've
cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays
and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Great! Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. </p>

<p>(She picks up the box and the bottom falls out, spilling all of the pictures onto
Monica's neat little piles.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix
you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you
get all the margarita stuff ready.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some
cash.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that! </p>

<p>(Rachel slowly leaves the apartment.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Gary's cop car, Ross is in the front seat with Gary of course. Chandler is in
the back seat.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It is starting to get dark out there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.</p>

<p>(Gary reaches up to grab that little light that cops have for unmarked cop cars.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> It's called the cherry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's the&#151;Chandler!!</p>

<p>(Chandler starts laughing at his joke.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich
in the world!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-ho, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yep!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for
this car.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <b>Your</b> tax dollars?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>[Time lapse, they're still on the ride along and Joey is just sniffing his sandwich.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich
really does smell good.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Did I say you could smell it?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can't smell your sandwich?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey
just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you thinking about Monica?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, what's that like?</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, Rachel is just entering. She takes off her coat and heads for
the kitchen. As she does, she knocks something off of a bookcase next to the kitchen door
with her coat and it breaks.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please!
Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the
stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and
finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone
rings.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!</p>

<p>(Rachel runs over and answers the phone with the blender in hand.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! What's up?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt,
some margarita mix, and tequila.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So all we have is ice?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> See if he has ice.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(She hangs up the phone and starts to head back to the kitchen and notices some money
lying out, stops, reaches down to pick it up, the phone rings causing her to drop it, she
quickly puts it back, and heads for the kitchen.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (on answering machine) Hello Ross? It's Emily. (Rachel runs back into the
room with the tequila.) I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married
tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a
mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you
are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The ride along.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So where are we going next?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise
him coming home.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes
a little bit before he lawyers up?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, no one talks like that!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I'm more cop than you two!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How do you figure that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there
flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!</p>

<p>(Gary just glares at him.)</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Ross has been demoted to the back seat with Joey and Chandler. He's not
too happy about it.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, Rachel is playing Emily's message to Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (on answering machine) Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not,
but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (does Rachel's) Nooo!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (does Monica's) I know!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! We can't do that!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back
and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling,
neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know
that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn&#146;t give us the right
to erase his message!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come
on! Doesn&#146;t that give me the right to control him&#151;help him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't think he's the one who needs help.</p>

<p>(They both sit down.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about
running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what
she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's
he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I
mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine,
all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same
people.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to
play on him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, <b>you </b>are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!
I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)</p>
<b>

<p>Answering Machine:</b> Your messages have been erased.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noooooooo!</p>

<p>[Scene: The ride along, they're all waiting outside of the witness's house and still in
the car in the same places as before.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can <b>go down</b>!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> No. But that reminds me, (handing back a clipboard) sign this.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What is it?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap
your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What? What? What is it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Is everything okay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.</p>

<p>(They all turn and look away. Suddenly a loud bang sounds out and in slow motion Joey
slowly throws his body over Ross. Gary is shocked at what he sees while Chandler is
obviously hurt.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. (Joey slowly moves off of
Ross.) Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Ross) You okay man?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh. Thank Joey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, <b>HELLO</b>!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, Monica has all the supplies she needs and is getting ready to
leave.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, I guess we should go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, wait. Wait.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah well unless we tell him.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with
you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of
it.</p>

<p>(The phone rings.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this
feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay?
Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the guys are returning from the ride along to find Phoebe already
there.]</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (excited) John Glenn is here?!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> No, Joey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, we had the most <b>incredible</b> night! Okay, so, we're in the
car&#133;</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Wait! Hold on! (He goes over to Phoebe and gives her a kiss.) (To Phoebe)
Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (To Ross) Okay, go ahead.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And <b>bang</b>! A shot was fired.
And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> My God, Joey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pouting) It was a car backfire!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but-but <b>he</b> didn't know that!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I didn't know that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like
you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Who jumps at loud noises!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! I could've died tonight.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think
I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up
and starts for the door.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I <b>do</b> have a newfound <b>respect</b> for <b>life</b>.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (To Phoebe) So you wanna get some dinner?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now,
I'd throw my body on you.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad
neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bye!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross and <b>Joey:</b></b> Bye!</p>

<p>(They leave as Ross stares in awe at Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the
same day!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is pacing as Joey enters.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude! How come you took off? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Is something wrong?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You dove in front of Ross! Ross!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I do not hate Ross!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want
Ross out of the picture.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What picture?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but
y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No!
I&#133;knew&#133;you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's
not street like us!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you
would for me. That's the bottom line.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross.
Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> From a bullet!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know it doesn't make much sense&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> <b>Much</b> sense?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you risked your life, for a sandwich!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the
sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich
and holds it out for Chandler) here.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!</p>

<p>(Chandler takes a bite.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How good is that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, Rachel is trying to repair the thing she broke earlier, but
gets interrupted by hearing Ross at the door. She panics and throws the thing into the
kitchen. And runs to the couch as Ross enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Y'know what? <b>You</b> are in our apartment all the time! Okay?
This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had
an actual near death experience!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! What? What happened?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And somebody took a shot at me!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (gasps) Really?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody
was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I&#133;I survived! And I was filled with this-this
great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every
opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because a car backfired?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole &quot;seizing&quot;
thing but um, Emily called you today.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You talked to her?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But
it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, okay, what-what did she say?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and
did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because&#151;I'm sorry, all right. Because
y'know what? She didn't want me&#151;not important. The point is, I was right. Your
decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right,
no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you <b>really</b>
want to get back into that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my
ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to
mean something!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, Ross! That was <b>not</b> a near death experience! That was barely
an experience!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to
seize! Y'know?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is
about escaping stuff.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death,
y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to <b>escape</b> getting back together with
Emily?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I
really don't wanna see or talk to her.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, there you go!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughing) Close call day.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh?</p>

<p>(Ross hits the playback button.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on machine) &quot;Hey Ross, it's you!&quot; (Hits the stop button) Oh
yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. (She heads for the door again.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica
here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I want my money back.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps,
right?</p>

<p>(Ross is stunned.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a
good story.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but
heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a
<b>fantastic</b> military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you
guys.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Before or after you were shot by your own troops?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all
of us.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in
any way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you
all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.</p>

<p>(Joey gets all happy with himself, while the rest of the gang is less than enthused.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Gary, Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler are there.]</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (To Phoebe) Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm fine, thanks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get
some tea.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(Monica leaves and Chandler moves to talk to Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hiya doin' pumpkin?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nope. (Chandler nods in agreement.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Gary and Monica at the counter.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (shocked) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> What do you, what do you think?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {<i>And I just
can't hide it</i>!<i> I'm about to lose control and I think I like it</i>! Sorry, just
couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do <b>not</b> get her flowers.
Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral&#133;</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (To Phoebe) I'll see you after work sweetie. (Kisses her.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Bye! </p>

<p>(Gary exits and Monica rejoins them.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, what movie should we see?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?! Really?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I
couldn't hold it in any longer!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can't believe this!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's
fast!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, but it <b>is</b> fast. Isn't it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohhhh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, what are you gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don't know. I'll just handle it&#151;I'll ask you to talk to him!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Me?! Why me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him
scared like you! Make him a&#133;man!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm
a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her
tea.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of
it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he
nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are playing catch with a little foam globe.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten <b>Island</b>.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an
island.</p>

<p>(The game resumes.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, what time is it?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (looks at his watch) 2:17.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it,
for like an hour?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you serious?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say
anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his
pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey, you guys&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is Monica here?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey and <b>Ross:</b></b> No.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna
like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I
was a little girl.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You bought Shawn Cassidy!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? </p>
<b>

<p>Joey and <b>Ross:</b></b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross
stares in shock.) Check it out!</p>

<p>(Joey turns and looks at quite possibly one of the ugliest pets that you can possibly
buy on the planet. Rachel has bought herself a hairless cat. Yep, a hairless cat! Joey and
Ross start to get sick.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What-what is it?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What the hell is that?!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's a, it's a cat!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> <b>That</b>, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes it is!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why is it inside out?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How much did you pay for that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? How much?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> A thousand bucks.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ON A CAT??!!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's not a cat!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a
little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap
and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little
political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are <b>not</b> the place to
buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably
won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you
want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly
scheduled programming.}</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's not a cat!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care
what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both
glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!</p>

<p>(Rachel goes into the bathroom as the guys continue throwing the ball.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how
long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, the ball thing.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without
dropping it?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, <b>yeah</b> it would! Let's do it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay!</p>

<p>(They throw the ball back and forth once.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (catches the ball) Uh-oh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler and Joey's, Ross is seen throwing the ball into the bathroom,
presumably where Joey is currently using the facilities.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?</p>

<p>[Scene: the 5<sup>th</sup> Precinct, Gary's precinct, Chandler has come to talk to him
about commitment. And as he's walking through the door he notices a couple of &quot;Ladies
of the night&quot; sitting there. (If you know what I mean.)]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Gary, I'm here to report a crime.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (laughs, then suddenly serious) What's up?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with
you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Sure. Okay.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be y'know, live-living together!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean scared.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> No, I mean happy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Scared? Happy?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Chandler, what-what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived
with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to
bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> I know! I can't wait!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Were you're parents happy, or something?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find
someone that I really love. I just&#151;I wanna be around her as much as I can.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> So you know what I'm talking about, right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in
with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> No, it's too soon for you guys.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pause) Yeah, you're right about that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are still playing catch.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> &#133;now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they
discovered what <b>appeared</b> to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws!
How did it get there?!</p>

<p>{Y'know, sometimes I think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to
trip me up. But it won't work. I'll always have the last laugh! &lt;manical_laugh.wav&gt;
Okay, so maybe I'm a little deluded, it's probably just my spellchecker. But, I must admit
I did get Mesozoic and Paleozoic on the first attempt. Yay me! Anyhoo&#133;}</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.</p>

<p>{Oh, all right!&nbsp; Geez, I can't have <strong>any</strong> fun!}</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey guys!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter)
It was right here, where is it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How do you know? You don't have a watch.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and
just help me find it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I don't know&#133;. Yeah, can't do it.</p>

<p>(He throws it back to Ross, but it's intercepted by Monica and the guys both scream in
horror.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica, whatever you do, do <b>not</b> drop that ball!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, we haven't dropped it in&#133; (Looks to Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> 2 hours, 27 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Monica has joined in and is calling to get out of work.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into
work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it
way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick
again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up
and keeps throwing the ball.)</p>

<p>(Rachel enters.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Rach!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are
covered with scratches.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, it's my cat.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (shocked) What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah, I got a cat.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I don't want a cat!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You guys this cat is <b>nothing</b> like my grandmother's cat. I mean,
it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it
just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, &quot;Rachel!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me
300!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I was gonna let you play with it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is drinking coffee as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes I did, and I think you should do it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky
lady.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the <b>one</b> thing
you can do! The <b>one</b> thing! And you can't even do that right! God!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of
here, good for nothing.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Hey Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey Gar!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (To Phoebe) Hi sweetie. (Kisses her.) Hi, can I talk to you for a second?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> You look very pretty today.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Here's the thing.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Y'know I <b>really</b> want to move this relationship forward.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying
still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.) </p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Phoebe?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> I want you to move in with me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean
there's so much we don't know about each other.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (disappointed) Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I just&#151;I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (disappointed more) Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just&#151;I'm worried
it's gonna be a big mistake.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (on the verge of tears) Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Which is why my answer is yes!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> (suddenly happy) Really?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so&#133;happy. (She's not happy.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Ross, and Monica are still playing catch, with
Chandler looking on. Joey throws the ball to Monica who catches it and whips it at Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same
team!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That's right baby.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the
game.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He's a dropper!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, that's right!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not a dropper!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's throwing and catching!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control
and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)</p>

<p>(Rachel enters with the &quot;cat&quot; and the chick and the duck start to get riled
up.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my&#151;Oh good God!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I
don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Baking it didn't help, huh?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I tried! They won't take her back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, why won't they take it back?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,
what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what
to do with it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all
scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)</p>

<p>(Monica sneezes.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My
vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay.
It's okay. Man, that was close.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe and <b>Gary:</b></b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> We have <b>great</b> news!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Congratulations! Congrats!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know, I'm so excited!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> So am I!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the <b>most</b>
excited!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Okay, I'll see you at the station later.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> All right.</p>

<p>(Phoebe closes the door behind him.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So you're moving in with him. What happened?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I <b>do</b>
really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the
money I'll save on stamps.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why, do you write him a lot?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of
stamps. Don't they?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!</p>

<p>(Rachel enters with the cat, wearing the oven mitt, and startles Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.</p>

<p>[Scene: Gary's precinct, Phoebe is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn
Heights?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, nothing.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Oh really?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Nothing at all?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't
have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh!</p>

<p>(He takes her into one of those typical interrogation rooms you see on TV and in the
movies. Which is really appropriate here, since this is a TV show. What are the odds of
that?)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? (Closes the door and takes
off his coat.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?
You-you checked the <i>Post</i>?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> In a minute. You-you checked today's <i>Post</i>?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, yeah! Today's.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> 'Cause uh, this is today's <i>Post</i> (produces one from the other chair)
and uh, these are the listings I found. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. (Points)
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights,
(points) Brooklyn Heights!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just
bragging!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Let me tell you what I think might be going on. (Phoebe looks down in
shame.) No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she does
so) Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said,
&quot;Yes&quot; but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone.
Does that sound at all possible to you?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. Yes! Fine! I <b>am</b> someone! You want me to say it? I have
doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Phoebe&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it <b>is</b> soon. And
there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything
I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both
our names on the mailbox.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That's so sweet.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine!
We don't have to move in together. I just&#151;I want you to be happy</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Living with you would make me happy.</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Phoebe, you <b>don't</b> have to say that.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!</p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
(Hugs him.) </p>

<p><b>Gary:</b> Oh that's great!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the
glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these
rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!</p>

<p>[Scene: The street outside Central Perk, Rachel is trying to sell the cat.]</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 1:</b> (looks into the box) Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's not a baby! It's a cat!</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 1:</b> Eew! It's creepy looking!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no! No! It's actually&#151;it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!
(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 1:</b> (laughs) No, I hate cats.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All
right? Move on!</p>

<p>(Another woman approaches.)</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 2:</b> Wow! What an unusual cat!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 2:</b> Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go
to the shelter (Good for her) but&#133; Okay, why not?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 2:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, a thousand.</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 2:</b> I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more
of an investment than a cat.</p>

<p><b>Woman No. 2:</b> Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. (Starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you
know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call
the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave
the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled)
Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her
again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Ross, Monica, and now Chandler are still playing
catch. The guys are exhausted and sitting around the room. Monica is still standing all
pumped up and being hyper-competitive yet again. {Okay! We get it! She's competitive!!
Must we see <b>all</b> the time?!}]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm starving! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check
time!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented
this game!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Please! I made this game what it is.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Not fun anymore?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'm still hungry! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand
right? Are you with me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I am!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys
all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.</p>

<p>[Cut to her apartment where Rachel is sitting at the table.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs.

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime
you want.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on
the table and everyone gasps.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one
needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official
ballplayers can drop the ball!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> All right. Okay. I'm starving! (They all get up, thus officially ending the
game.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door
and everyone watches her leave.)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You guys wanna eat here?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! As long as we're here!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball
around?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know. My arm is killing me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm <b>anything</b>
but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the
phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his
chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe are there reading. Rachel is sitting on the
couch flanked by Ross and Monica. She suddenly stops reading and starts blinking her left
eye as if it's bothering her. The problem is that Joey is on her left and thinks she's
winking at him and winks back. Ross is watching this and isn't quite sure of what to make
of it.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, my eye is a little itchy.</p>

<p>(Ross turns to look at Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so Richard, Richard!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh God, here we go!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like
freaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird
thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> All right, fine.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Rach, remember that great song, <i>Me, Myself, and I</i>? (And on
the &quot;I&quot; part she mimics poking her eye.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (flinches again) Monica! Come on!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes
his eye)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How much did <b>I</b> love <i>The King and I</i>? (Oh, you get the
point by now.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Me too! Me too! Me too! (Yeah, he does the same thing.) </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just stop it! Come on!</p>

<p>(Joey howls in pain and holds his eye.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You okay there man?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I got too excited!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are eating breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, give him a kiss for me!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, bye!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bye!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Later! (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I
didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow umm, calm down.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm trying, but <b>man</b> that guy can push my buttons!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why are so mad at him?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, it just seems that&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by
the way?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, &quot;Ross&quot; on it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess
what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl
in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And <b>then</b>, she
disappears&#133; But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady
answers the door and I say, &quot;Where's Betsy?&quot; Right? And she says, &quot;Betsy's
been dead for 10 years.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh-oh, chilling!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To
Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know that means buddy!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las
Vegas.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Thanks Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh umm, not go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh!
(She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose
knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through
the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box
and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at
this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to
reschedule!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All
right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes
she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is reading a map as Phoebe enters.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh hey Joey! What's up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot
right?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I've been around.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern
route?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a
beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of
no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Great! Problem solved!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, back to square one.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (quickly) Yes!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax.
Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or
egg whites?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Peanut butter!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> A swimmer!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Monica. Oh&#133; huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ascot!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> North route or south route?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> North route!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bamn! There you go! Huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey man, what's up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure, what do you want to see?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know, umm&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a
table previously.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What's with her?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you
questions and you answer real quick. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What do you like better action or comedy?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Action.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? </p>

<p>(Ross pauses and looks at him, Joey motions for him to hurry up.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Dude, you are sick.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica's eye doctor's office, Monica and Rachel are waiting in an exam room and
looking at this big white thing used to check eyes. I have no idea what it is, and if an
ophthalmologist happens to know what that is, let me know.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! What does <b>that</b> thing do?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, I'm outta here!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm kidding! I'm kidding!</p>

<p>(Rachel heads for the door but is intercepted by the doctor.)</p>
<b>

<p>The Doctor:</b> Hi Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>The Doctor: </b>I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't
worry everything's gonna be just fine.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So were done then!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> Almost! But first, we gotta start.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> This is a glaucoma test.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> Sit down.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> But your chin here. (She does so.) Now, you'll feel a small puff of
air in each eye.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (jerks back from the tester) What?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> A small puff of air, now come on!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> Here we go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> 1&#133;2&#133;3! (Rachel jerks back on 3.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head
back.) Okay.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> Ready?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> 1&#133;2&#133; (She flinches on 2 this time.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> That's okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (Monica backs off.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Okay!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> 1&#133;2! (She flinches again.) (Gives up.) Y'know what? You're
young; you probably don't have glaucoma.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow!
Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at
people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to
flinch and scream at him.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want
you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Great!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> And I'll fit you for a glass eye.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F
D.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Miller:</b> Very good Monica! You know where they are.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.)
(To Rachel) And you don't get one!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, and Joey are there.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a
100% better.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> They're still in my coat.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Damn!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! You ready to go?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or
will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)</p>

<p>(Monica stares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I love you.</p>

<p>{There's another continuity error here. Before Monica says I love you, Chandler's
holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they
were folding nicely. After she says the line and the camera cuts back to Chandler, you can
only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it
was folded sloppily, unlike before. Hey, you notice things while spending this much time
on this!}</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big
hotel suite?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a
real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big
hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right
in Joey's pocket.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Did you not hear the plot of the movie? &quot;She's been dead for ten
years.&quot; I'm gonna be a millionaire!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I just wanna say good-bye to you guys <b>and</b> to see if you guys will
place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You got it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right!</p>

<p>(Joey nods to Chandler, no way!)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, bye-bye now!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bye!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Bye you guys!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Bye-bye!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I wanna say good-bye at the car!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the
puss.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See ya! (Walks out.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs
after him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away)
Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and
she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He
grabs the magazine away from her.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please,
tell me what it is I did!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, if you don't know I can't help you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I can't help you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Apology accepted.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. So we're, we're good?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (quietly) Bye, fat ass. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did
that mad you so mad at me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don't know! I don't remember!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat
ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney. </p>

<p>(Ross isn't sure what to do with that comment.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe's cab, Joey and Chandler are headed across the George Washington bridge
on their way to Las Vegas. Joey is driving.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road
once.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly
looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Isn't that Ross's money?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a
bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind
Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Too dry.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Is this movie gonna be my big break?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (shocked) What?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude you said, &quot;No!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I also said, &quot;Yes!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don't believe this!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all
over my big break.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if
it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, you don't want me on the trip?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Not if you're gonna be like this!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like
that I'll lie.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right
now!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound
of numerous car horns.) Get out!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Get out!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no
sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are there. Ross is trying to
figure out why Phoebe's mad at him.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No that made me feel precious.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?
Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? Sometimes it's&#133; (Does the fist thing.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he
starts to lose.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, <b>I'm</b> the baby. (Points at his eye.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Eh! Stop it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler! What are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Why?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where
you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That game should not be played without my supervision. </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that
uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do
anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he
should've pushed me off of the bridge.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What's in the bag?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts
that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with
one leg?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I do!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to apply her eye drops while Monica looks
on.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only
problem is, it's not over her eye.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Not even close.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay! All right! Let's do it!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Put your head back.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Now, open your eyes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, they are. (No they're not.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (thinks) Four.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, I was thinking four.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run?
Okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No drops!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Great!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> On three, 1&#133;2&#133;3! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the
drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the
eyedropper.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, well, you said it was practice!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Then why did you move?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because I knew you were lying!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by
her legs.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God!
Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I am going&#133; I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her
stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm&#133; I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
(She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.) </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!</p>

<p>(Monica starts biting on the eyedropper, spraying the fluid all over. But Rachel keeps
turning her head back and forth and Monica keeps missing.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica! Stop it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a
fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqu pose,
at least for primetime TV.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse, Phoebe and Monica are playing cards as the
phone rings.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's
proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened.
Y'know he's really upset about it.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds
out what I did with his sweater vests!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What did you do to his sweater vests?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica
listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, dude!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat.
What-what is it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks
Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him!
I wanna talk to him!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering&#133; (We hear the dial
tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las
Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of
porn&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that
why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay,
clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What do you like better flora or fauna?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fauna.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Garfunkle.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why are you mad at me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You said I was boring--Ohh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> When did I say you were boring?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe! You and I have <b>never</b> played chess!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing
chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron
Diaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a <b>chance</b> this may have been a dream.</p>

<p>[Scene: The desert outside of Las Vegas, Joey is arriving and we hear the song, <i>Name</i>.
Y'know, (singing) <i>I've been through the desert on a horse with no name! It felt good to
be out of the rain. In the desert, you can't remember your name, 'cause there ain't no one
for to give you no pain. La&#133;la&#133;la-la-la, la, la, la, la-la-la</i>. You get the
idea. Anyhoo, he pulls up and stops. As he gets out of the car, he spills a huge pill of
fast food containers out of the foot well.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.</p>

<p><b>Stanley:</b> Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wh-what?! Why?!</p>

<p><b>Stanley:</b> It's a money thing, we don't have any.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (laughs) You're kidding right?</p>

<p><b>Stanley:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Stanley:</b> It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money
soon, so if could just uh, hang out.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, hang out?! How long?</p>

<p><b>Stanley:</b> I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will
always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Stanley:</b> Eh, worth a shot. (Gets into his car.) Look Joey, let me know where
you're staying, okay? (The car peels away.)</p>

<p>(I think one of the grips walk up to Joey, mainly because there's a credit for The
Grip. What the heck is a grip anyway?!)</p>

<p><b>The Grip:</b> Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>The Grip:</b> These got left for ya. (He hands him a bunch of helium balloons.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your
big break. </p>

<p>(The rest of the crew start to drive away leaving Joey sad, alone, and holding his
congratulatory balloons as the song comes up again. <i>La-la-la. See, I've been through
the desert on a horse with no name! It felt good to be out of the rain! In the desert you
can't remember your name, 'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La-la-la, la,
la, la&#133;</i>)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the phone is ringing.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (answering it) Hello?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want
you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta
go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here! </p>

<p>[Cut to Joey hanging up the phone in Vegas. He's wearing a Roman gladiator's uniform
and goes over to join a family to pose for a picture. You see, he's apparently taken a job
at <i>Caesar's Palace</i>.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.</p>
<b>

<p>The Husband:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your
stay at <i>Caesar's</i>! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me
now.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, The gang is surrounding Rachel at key positions.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Rach, can you pass me the <i>TV Guide</i>?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yep!</p>

<p>(As she moves to get it, Monica yells&#133;)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Go!!</p>

<p>(Phoebe jumps to the floor as Ross tackles Rachel off of the couch. Chandler helps push
Rachel onto the floor by jumping over the back of the couch. Phoebe grabs Rachel's head to
hold it still and opens Rachel's eye as Monica jumps onto Chandler's back to administer
the torture--I mean medicine.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone
climbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is sitting in the living room and Phoebe is
standing in the kitchen as the phone rings.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire<b> </b>world that <b>I</b>
want to talk to are right here.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (smiles) Okay! (Goes to answer the phone.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (under her breath) Sucker!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Joey!</p>

<p>[Cut to Las Vegas, Joey is on the phone and wearing his gladiator costume.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to
my ATM card can, can you get it for me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sure! Where is it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh! So you're 5639?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! (She nods no to Chandler) Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which
is a big mistake because it is real! Real!</p>

<p><strong>A Casino Boss:</strong> Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!</p>

<p>[Cut to Phoebe]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Who was that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar
for my tastes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all
week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in
person.</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?</p>

<p>[Cut to Phoebe]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! (She hands the phone to Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Joey) Hey!</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don't come out here!</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to
prove that to you in person!</p>

<p><strong>A Tourist: </strong>(To Joey) Would you mind doing a picture with us?</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, what was that?</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good
talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that
picture.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica?
(Goes into Monica's bedroom.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe,
I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Which Richard?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> <b>The</b> Richard.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having
lunch with him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But again, Simmons. Go on.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I
didn't feel anything at all!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I
just don't want anything to spoil that.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> On a totally different bet.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It's almost our anniversary!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your
annoying friend Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Awww! Now you're just <b>my</b> annoying friend Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I got you a present!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(He starts taking his time opening it. Finally Monica snaps.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two
tickets to Vegas!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus
we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out
plane-aversary.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do we have to?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how
excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own,
ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I think we should see other people.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But we can go, right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's a great idea. (They kiss)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I'm gonna go too!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda <b>our</b> (His and Monica's) anniversary.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering with Ross) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to
surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes
me!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't
miss that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a
year for this.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (coughing) Art lover!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What'd you say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I said art lover.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is that supposed to be an insult?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't know, I'm very tired. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That sounds great.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself
for a night.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Naked alone time.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn&#146;t mean I wanna walk around
naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?</p>

<p>[Scene: An airplane cabin, Phoebe has the aisle seat, Chandler the window, and Monica's
stuck in that horrible middle seat.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to
London?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one
from her purse.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right
back. (Gets up and heads aft.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aww! I love you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can I give you a present now?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man!
Don&#146;t tell me I did this!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I love the &quot;I forgot the present&quot; fake out!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How do you feel about the, &quot;I really did forgot the present,
please forgive me&quot; not fake out?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh that's okay. Don&#146;t worry about it, you can give it to me when we
get back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohh that's the <b>worse</b> thing that can happen on an anniversary
ever!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the
Richard thing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What-what Richard thing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no. [The patented version.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What Richard thing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to
go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad
and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!
It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Great!</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, London 1&#133;</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is coming out of the bathroom after a shower
wearing only her bath robe, walks into the kitchen, and opens the fridge. As she bends
over to grab a bottle of wine, her robe falls open (Damn this network primetime
programming, we didn't see anything!) and she quickly closes it again. But then realizes
she didn't have to do that. So she closes the fridge and stands next to the table, thinks
about it for a little while and&#133;]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up
guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I
wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her
head.) <i>Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen&#133;naked! I'm picking up an orange. </i>(Does
so)<i> I'm naked! </i>(Goes into the living room)<i> Lighting the candles, naked, and
carefully.</i> (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body
away.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Ross's apartment, he's sitting by his window looking at an art book. As he's
turning the page, he glances up and notices something.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (in his head)<i> Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I
am looking at this.</i> (Looks back at his book.) <i>Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush
strokes</i>&#151;<i>Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She
knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely
tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?</p>
</i>

<p>[Cut back to Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel is singing along with a song and
dancing while facing the big picture window. Y'know, I think I'd pay real good money to be
on the other side of that window!]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (singing) <i>Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!</i>
(There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to
answer the door.) <i>Love to love ya, baby!</i> (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks
through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's
leaning against the door jam.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the scene is continued from where we left off before the
break.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> May I come in?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, yeah, if you want too.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Do <b>you</b> want me too?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, sure?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes
off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.)
This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the
question of &quot;Us.&quot; (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off
his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And um, what-what is that Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your
nakedness?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with
you?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other
one and heads for the door.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh wow! I&#146;m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the
question of &quot;us?&quot;</p>

<p>(Ross storms off embarrassed.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas, the Strip, slot
machines, a couple other gaming tables all set to the tune of you guessed it, <i>Money</i>.
Anyhoo, we finally get through that and watch Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe enter <i>Caesar's
Palace</i> carrying their luggage.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much
better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak
and lobster dinner. Huh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you don't eat animals. </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle
down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in
his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.)
Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Love your condoms my man.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why are you dressed as a gladiator?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a
gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut?
Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Who are you talking too?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him.
Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work
here.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why?! What happened?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working
here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I'm so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't
have to share everything with everybody.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I <b>knew</b> you were not okay with that.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So you're a gladiator! Wow!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, what-what's going on?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica had lunch with Richard.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dawson?! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Noo! But that would've been so cool!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! Her boyfriend Richard!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you <b>not</b>
trust me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about
it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks. (They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Aww, there we go.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I <b>love</b> Vegas!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pushing her away from another hug) Next time?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, so close.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's so funny, because I think I just did!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really,
I don't even want to be around you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fine with me!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Fine! Happy Anniversary!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a <b>big</b>
misunderstanding.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No it is not!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you talking&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.)</p>

<p>[Scene: An aircraft cabin, Ross and Rachel are on their way to Vegas.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm
going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is <b>not</b>
an invitation to the physical act of love.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that
easily.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! You totally get embarrassed!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is that so?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you
want it! Okay?! I am <b>not</b> gonna to have <b>sex</b> with you in the bathroom! (Rachel
sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler's hotel room, he's sitting there with Joey who's talking about his
helmet and running his hand through that feathery thing at the top.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They
would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get
dirty so they would stick it right&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't <b>believe</b>
this is how I'm spending my anniversary.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a
hundred bucks today.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000.
Can you believe that? $5,000!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body
and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and
turn it into $5,000! And <b>then</b> I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie
going again!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good luck! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I see.</p>

<p>(Joey exits as Chandler shakes his head.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The casino bar, Phoebe and Monica are sitting at the bar, while Wayne Newton's
signature song <i>Danke Schoen</i> is playing in the background.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to the bartender) Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with
Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am <b>so</b>
sorry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna
see Richard again.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him
that you're sorry and that you love him.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to
find Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas,
number one!</p>

<p>[Cut to the casino, Monica is walking through it past the craps table when she notices
a chip on the floor. She picks it up and heads to the table.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes
her head no.)</p>

<p><b>The Croupier:</b> Comin' out. Place your bet. (Monica does so.) Dice are out. (The
woman next to Monica rolls the dice.) Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! (Monica won
and doubled the chip.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p>[Scene: An airplane cabin, Ross and Rachel are both reading as a guy stops by their
row.]</p>

<p><strong>Guy: </strong>(To Rachel) So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom. (Ross
giggles.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?</p>

<p>(Ross keeps giggling and Rachel decides upon revenge. She gets up and kisses the rather
large man in the seat in front of Ross on the back of his head. The guy turns around
angrily.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! What are you&#133; I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really
likes you.</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Ross is drinking something and decides to get Rachel again.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who
had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)</p>

<p>[Time lapse, Rachel pushes the flight attendant call button, takes Ross's drink, and
spills it into his lap.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What the? What&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds
after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't
real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants
would be dry.) Hi! </p>

<p><strong>The </strong><b>Flight Attendant:</b> Miss? May I help you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to
have had a little accident.</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Caesar's Palace Casino</i>, Joey is approaching one of the blackjack tables
on his quest to make enough money for his movie.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)</p>

<p><b>Blackjack Dealer:</b> Changing one hundred! (Gives him the change.) Good luck sir.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (betting all 100) Let's ride.</p>

<p><b>Blackjack Dealer:</b> (Deals the cards) 13.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but
when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his
hand next to the dealer's hand.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler's room, Joey is relaying to Chandler his amazing discovery.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler! You are <b>not</b> gonna believe this! I have found my identical
hand twin!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (totally confused) What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> My identical hand twin!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What's an identical hand twin?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was
incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at
my hands in a mirror!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Don&#146;t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (totally confused) How?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money!
Come on! Identical hands!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Again I must go back to, how?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much
would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, are you unsupporting me again?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away.
Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!</p>

<p>(Joey starts to leave to embark on his genius moneymaking scheme, but is freaked out
slightly when as he goes to open the door, there's a mysterious knock. He calms himself
down and opens the door to reveal Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I found my identical hand twin!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, you are <b>so</b> lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did
you guys make up?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But she just came up here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That was Joey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I wonder where she is. That is so weird.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she
came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta
find her.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks
herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Caesar's Palace Casino</i>, Chandler is looking for Monica while Tom Jones's
signature song is playing in the background (Getting the theme yet? Tom Jones, Wayne
Newton, casinos&#133; They're in Vegas people! Catch up!) <i>It's Not Unusual</i>, y'know,
&quot;<i>It's not unusual to be loved by anyone! It's not unusual to have fun with anyone!
&nbsp; But when I see you hanging about with anyone, it's not unusual to see me cry!
&nbsp; I wanna die.</i>&quot; Well, while that's playing he spots Monica playing craps and
in victory hug the guy next to her. Chandler turns and walks out.]</p>

<p>[Scene: That same plane cabin, Ross is working on a crossword puzzle and Rachel is
asleep against his shoulder. She shifts a little bit and Ross suddenly gets an idea. An
evil idea when he looks at his pen. Then we have a little time lapse, the plane has landed
and everyone is disembarking. The flight attendant is saying bye-bye to everyone.]</p>

<p><strong>The </strong><b>Flight Attendant:</b> (to another passenger) Welcome to Las
Vegas.</p>

<p>(Rachel approaches and we see the fruits of Ross's evil plan. He has drawn a moustache
and beard on Rachel. The flight attendant just ignores it.)</p>

<p><strong>The </strong><b>Flight Attendant:</b> (To Rachel) Thank you! (Not sure of
herself) Enjoy your flight?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)</p>

<p><strong>The </strong><b>Flight Attendant:</b> (To Ross) Hope you had a nice flight.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh, it was the best!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The casino, Ross and Rachel are entering.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think the check in is that way. (Points)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ahh.</p>

<p>(A young boy sees Rachel, points, and starts laughing.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents
drag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe! (They hug.) </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys are here! Yay!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess
umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the
slot machine Phoebe was just at.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pancho Vila?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's
&quot;make-up.&quot;)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't&#133;
(She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew
on me?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, you wet my pants!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Whoa, what kind of party was this?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I
can&#151;you have <b>so</b> crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction.
Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)</p>

<p>(The old lady at Phoebe's machine wins. Phoebe turns around in shock.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ugh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> M-M-Mole people?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? No-no, a lurker.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. What's a lurker?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits
for you to give up and then&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Kills you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohhh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How do you know about this?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance&#151;karate
lessons.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Dance karate?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a
little dance-type sway.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it <b>won't</b>
come off!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It won't come off!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Hey-hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her
purse.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Joey) Thanks man.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi. (She hugs Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand
twin!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Your what?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This
thing is a gold mine!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! That's not gonna make you any money!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live
with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the
thumb.</p>

<p>[Scene: The craps table, Monica is on a big roll.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What does it look like? I'm going home.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after
him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I&#146;m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was
trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I
won't! He means nothing to me!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a
naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Not any more.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going
home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is
empty.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.</p>

<p>[Scene: A blackjack table, it's the same one Joey's hand twin was working at, only he's
not there anymore and has been replaced by a beautiful woman.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?</p>

<p><strong>The Woman Dealer: </strong>Which guy?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his
hand.) See?</p>

<p><strong>The Woman Dealer: </strong>I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was
here before me just went to the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?</p>

<p><strong>The Woman Dealer: </strong>Very busy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's hotel room, Rachel is still trying to get the ink off and
Ross is on the phone to the company. Wait a minute, why exactly are they sharing a hotel
room? Didn't they like break-up or something? Did I miss a memo? Or maybe, it's just
foreshadowing things to come. Who knows? Maybe the answer's at the bottom of the page.
Then again, maybe it isn't and it's just one of those things TV writers just don't
explain. Anyhoo&#133;]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you.
(Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, <b>she</b> didn't think so. (Listens) I know
it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway,
umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's
worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens)
Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the
phone) Yeah, it's not coming off.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! What else did he say?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So&#133;(Rachel stares at him.) Okay,
look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all
about it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, no! There is <b>no</b> way I am leaving this room looking like
this!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, I am a human doodle!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't
have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna <b>look</b> at you.
Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and
glares at him.) There are tons&#133;of&#133;freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one
will notice, I swear!</p>

<p>(They both exit.)</p>

<p>[Time lapse, they're both entering.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, there was <b>some</b> staring and pointing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel
glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge
and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big
drink! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.)
Macadamia nut?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (looking at the price list) Umm&#133; Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in
another direction.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The casino, Phoebe is playing on a slot machine. Suddenly the lurker sticks her
head around the aisle of slot machines.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get!
(She throws a quarter at her.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh! You made up!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, get a room.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We have one.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. Use it.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Men's room, Joey is entering and sees his hand twin washing his hands.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.) That's
right, you take good care of those babies!</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It's me, Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> Do I know you?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (holds up his hand) Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, so <b>what</b> are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> Nothing?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with
it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you <b>know</b> NASA's gonna wanna
talk to us!</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> (tries to leave) I have to get back to&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show!
Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a
song for us! (Singing, to the tune of <i>This Land is Your Land</i>) <i>This hand is your
hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!</p>
</i>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> That's okay. (Walks out.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (following him) But you haven't even heard the chorus!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's room, Ross is drinking a beer while Rachel is examining
herself in the mirror.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (gets up) All right. Y'know what? We don&#146;t have to go downstairs! We
can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, come
on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hit me!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at
this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I bet 20.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You're right! (Gives her the twenty she won.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Craps Table, Monica is still on her roll, only this time Chandler's with
her and she has a huge crowd of people around.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the
dice.) Yes!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Pick a number! That is your <b>only</b> job!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> 8. 8!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yay!!</p>

<p><b>The Croupier:</b> 8!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yay!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are
we?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Noo!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Two fours.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (Rolls the dice) </p>

<p><b>The Croupier:</b> 8!: </p>

<p><b>A Drunken Gambler:</b> (To Chandler) Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get
the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! <b>We</b> (motions
to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were
fighting about!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich&#151;Me neither! Okay, what do
I want now?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Another hard 8.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and
we get married here tonight.</p>

<p><b>Drunken Gambler:</b> Go! Come on! Roll!</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Roll-roll!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Shut up!! It <b>just</b> got interesting!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The Craps table, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What did you just say?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you serious?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
{Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I
guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!</p>

<p>(She rolls the dice, but one bounces out of the table.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?</p>

<p><b>Drunken Gambler:</b> It went under the table.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! </p>

<p>(He searches to his right; she searches to her left. They're both on their hands and
knees when they spot the die. It's propped up against the table leg, and it's not lying
flat. Both the four and the five are showing.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here it is! Here it is!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That could be a four or a five. It's your call.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It's a four.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think so too.</p>

<p>(Cue up the music as they move in and kiss. This time I think it's Perry Como, but I'm
not sure. It's <i>Everybody loves somebody, sometime! Everybody falls in love somehow!
Something in your kiss, just told me, my sometime, is now!</i>)</p>

<p>[Scene: The slot machines, Phoebe is still feeding quarters into the one-armed bandit
as the lurker peeks over the top of the machines.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker
scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her
in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!</p>

<p><b><b>The Lurker:</b></b> I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond
hair!</p>

<p>(They start smacking each other's cups, but Phoebe notices a security guard
approaching.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard
walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking
days are over!</p>

<p><b><b>The Lurker:</b></b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on
to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be
on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do
you leave?</p>

<p><b><b>The Lurker:</b></b> Also Monday.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What time? Maybe we can share a cab!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's room, they've pretty much consumed the entire mini-bar.
Needless to say, they're feeling no pain and are still playing blackjack.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit
me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with
each one.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (runs out of cards) We need more cards.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but
stumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, without
dialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We
would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!</p>

<p>(They both start laughing. There's a knock on the door.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have
to convince my hand twin to cooperate!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to
sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it.
Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are
you, are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.)
Hey Rach, how you doin'?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross, don't let her drink anymore! (Exits)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhh!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the
bed.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I&#133;I really miss downstairs.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.</p>

<p>[Cut to the casino, a very drunk and doodled on Rachel is walking arm in arm with an
equally drunk and doodled on Ross are walking through the casino and greeting people on
their way through. Ross has some whiskers and his nose colored in, along with his name on
his forehead.] </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well hello! I'm Ross!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good luck to ya!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to the
corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)</p>

<p>(They've made their way to the statue of the naked man that Chandler was leaning
against earlier.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (bowing) Hello!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (bowing) Hello!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross and <b>Rachel:</b></b> (bowing) Hello!</p>

<p>(They both continue on and Ross meows like a cat.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The slot machines, we see some guy not having any luck. Both Phoebe and the
Lurker are lurking him and each stick their heads around the corner at different times
This is all set to that <i>Pink Panther</i> song. Finally the guy gives up and walks past
the lurker's position, thus giving her the advantage. She scurries in and quickly drops a
coin in the slot before Phoebe gets there. Phoebe arrives slightly later and pulls the arm
just after the lurker deposits the coin and wins.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I won! I won! I finally won!</p>

<p><b><b>The Lurker:</b></b> I won! That was my quarter!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.)</p>

<p>(The security guard approaches.)</p>

<p><b><b>The Lurker:</b></b> (to the guard) Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter,
this is my money. (Motions to the jackpot.)</p>

<p><b>The Security Guard:</b> (To Phoebe) Is that true miss?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (quietly) Sells drugs to kids.</p>

<p><b>The Security Guard:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.)</p>

<p><b><b>The Lurker:</b></b> It was my quarter!</p>

<p><b>The Security Guard:</b> (To Phoebe) Was it her quarter?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How about we talk about this over dinner?</p>

<p><b>The Security Guard:</b> Okay lady, you're out of here.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to
that hell hole!!</p>

<p><b>The Security Guard:</b> I'm just taking you outside!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay. (Walks out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Gift Shop, Monica and Chandler are entering.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something
new, something borrowed, and something blue.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue
sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You're so efficient. I love you! </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Let's go! (Starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no-no! We need something old!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That'll work!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, now we just need something borrowed!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (looks around) Here just&#133;take this. (Hands her the sweater.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's stealing!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.</p>

<p>(She does so and it makes her look pregnant.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A blackjack table, Joey is moving in to try and get his hand twin (who's
dealing) to join him in his evil plot to rule the world! &quot;Join me, and together we'll
rule the universe as father and son!&quot; (Sorry, I had a little <i>Star Wars</i> creep
in there&#151;Ooh, I have a big spoiler for<i> The Phantom Menace</i>, Yoda lives at the
end! Ha-ha, spoiled it! Now you don't have to see it!)]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.)</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> Are you gonna play?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway&#133; (Shakes his
hands.)</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold
it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking
at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho!
(The dealer stares at him and he stops.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina
Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks
down) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> (To Joey) 14.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hit me! (He does so.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same
hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> Stop it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at
this table?</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> Please stop it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some
type of a uh, entertainment venue?</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> (To Joey) If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give
it too you!</p>

<p>(The security guard from before approaches and Phoebe tries to turn her back on him.) </p>

<p><b>The Security Guard:</b> (To Phoebe) Didn't I <b>just</b> throw you out of here?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!</p>

<p><b>The Security Guard:</b> Come on, lady! (Starts to escort her out.)</p>

<p><b>Joey's Hand Twin:</b> Please, please take him too. (Motions to Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by
the guard) I'm your hand twin!!</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>A Little White Chapel</i>, Chandler and Monica are entering.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello! One marriage please!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yep, we wanna get married! </p>

<p><strong>The Attendant: </strong>Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler and <b>Monica:</b></b> All right.</p>

<p>(They both sit down.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that's <i>The Wedding March</i>. Does, does that freak you out?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, only because that's the graduation song.</p>

<p>(The real <i>Wedding March</i> begins playing from behind the closed doors of the
chapel.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get
married!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)</p>

<p>(They storm out into the street.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!</p>

<p>(She goes one way; he goes the other. The camera pans back to Chandler and Monica, and
needless to say, they're standing there dumbstruck as The King's (Elvis Presley to the

seems to work out OK.<br>

ROSS: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the
little pouty chin.<br>
MONICA: And the fact that they're both monkeys.<br>

ROSS: Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.<br>

Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.<br>

ROSS: Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd
be little monkey raisins in it.<br>

ROSS: Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then
drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh,

ROB: I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, wow.<br>
<br>
ROB: Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was

JOEY: Ah, the stalker.<br>

ERICA: Never mind, it's open.<br>

CHANDLER: [Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We
might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Let's get out of here.<br>
<br>
[They run out and knock on Monica and Rachel's door]<br>

<br>
JOEY: OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me
'cause we've never met.<br>
CHANDLER: That's how radio stars escape stalkers.<br>
<br>
JOEY: She's comin'.<br>

<br>
ROSS: Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan,
answers to the name Marcel.<br>
<br>
LIPSON: Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh my God, what happened?<br>
<br>
LIPSON: Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then
he died.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I can't believe this.<br>
<br>
LIPSON: I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.'
It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.<br>
<br>
LIPSON: I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Zoo dollars?<br>

ERICA: Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching
someone's spinal cord.<br>
