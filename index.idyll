## Introduction

For this homework, I use the [building inventory dataset](https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spring2019online/week02/building_inventory.csv) from Week 2's materials.
This dataset includes information about public buildings in Illinois.

I am going to make two plots, one with Idyll's [built-in chart](https://idyll-lang.org/docs/component/chart), and one with [VegaLite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/).

## Built-in Chart
In this section, I try to plot the relationship between `Year Constructed` and `Year Acquired`. A built-in scatter plot is used here to better present each building with a specific dot.

[data name:"building" source:"building_inventory.csv" /]
[Chart type:"scatter" data:`building` domain:`[1750,2020]` range:`[1750,2020]` x:'Year Constructed' y:'Year Acquired' /]

From the plot above, we can see that most buildings were constructed and acquired in the same year, although there are several exceptions.

## Plot using VegaLite

For the second try, I would like to find out the status of buildings in each congressional district. The variables used here are `Congress Dist` and `Bldg Status`. A bar mark is used for the visualization as we don't need a variable for the y-axis; 
a bar chart is enough for showing the numbers of buildings in the congressional districts. 

[IdyllVegaLite data:building spec:`{
  width:500,
  height:200,
  mark:'bar',
  encoding:{
    x:{field:'Congress Dist',type:"nominal"},
    y:{aggregate:"count",type:"quantitative",title:"Number of Buildings"},
    color:{
      "field": "Bldg Status",
      "type": "nominal",
      "scale": {
        "domain": ["In Use", "In Progress", "Abandon"],
        "range": ["#e7ba52", "#c7c7c7", "#aec7e8"]
      }}
}}` /]

From the bar chart above, it is clear that most public buildings are still in use.
We can also find out that the number of public buildings differs much in different congressional districts.
